## Remaining Issues Analysis

### 1. TOC Link Mismatch Errors (~173 errors)
**Issue**: `kilocode-toc-link-mismatch` rule flags TOC links that don't match headings
**Root Cause**: Validation system not correctly parsing headings with emojis/special characters
**Example**: `#-research-context--next-steps` doesn't match `## üîç Research Context & Next Steps`
**Priority**: HIGH - Largest remaining error category

### 2. Navigation Warning Issues (~225 warnings)
**Issue**: `kilocode-glossary-link` and `kilocode-toc-navigation-link` warnings persist

**Priority**: MEDIUM - May require script refinement or validation logic adjustment

### 3. Cross-Reference Edge Cases (~100 errors)
**Issue**: Remaining `kilocode-cross-reference` errors from complex path scenarios
**Root Cause**: Edge cases in relative path resolution or complex file structures
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Mostly resolved, remaining edge cases

### 4. Missing Required Sections (6 remaining errors)
**Issue**: `kilocode-when-youre-here-required` and `kilocode-no-dead-ends-required`
