## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this
document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: This document covers \[DOCUMENT PURPOSE BASED ON FILE PATH].
- **Context**: Use this as a starting point or reference while navigating the project.
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together -
> documentation helps us understand how! ‚öôÔ∏è

- *Purpose:*\* Comprehensive reference for technical terms, concepts, and system-specific
  terminology
  used throughout KiloCode documentation.

> **Quantum Physics Fun Fact**: Just as quantum entanglement allows particles to be instantly
> connected regardless of distance, our glossary creates instant connections between concepts across
> the entire documentation system! üî¨

## Core System Concepts

### **API Request**

A single call to an external AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) containing a conversation history
and system prompt. Multiple API requests can occur within a single turn.

### **Chat History**

Persistent data structure containing all messages in a conversation, stored across sessions.
Includes metadata, timestamps, and conversation state.

### **Chat Session**

Active UI view of a chat history. A user can have multiple sessions open simultaneously, each
viewing different chat histories.

### **Concurrent Execution**

Multiple operations running simultaneously in Node.js's single-threaded event loop through
async/await scheduling and interleaving.

### **Green Text**

Visual indicator marking the end of an AI turn in the chat interface. Signals that the AI has
completed its response and is waiting for user input.

### **Message Queue**

System for queuing user messages when the system is busy processing other requests. Prevents message
loss during high-load periods.

### **Orchestrator**

Core system component responsible for task lifecycle management, subtask coordination, and execution
flow control. Acts as the "conductor" of the system.

### **Race Condition**

Concurrent execution scenario where multiple operations access shared resources without proper
synchronization, leading to unpredictable behavior.

### **Recursive Call**

Self-referential function call where a function calls itself, either directly or through a chain of
other functions. In KiloCode, this refers to the main task execution loop.

### **Sequential Execution**

Operations that run one after another in a predetermined order, ensuring predictable behavior and
resource access.

### **State Machine**

Mathematical model defining how a system transitions between different states based on events or
conditions. Used to model Task, Session, and Recursive Call behaviors.

### **Subtask**

Child task created by an orchestrator to handle specific portions of work. Subtasks run
independently but report back to their parent orchestrator.

### **Synchronization**

Mechanisms to coordinate concurrent operations and prevent race conditions, including locks, queues,
and atomic operations.

### **Task**

Active execution context representing a single conversation or work session. Tasks have states
(CREATED, RUNNING, PAUSED, COMPLETED, etc.) and lifecycle management.

### **Turn**

Complete user-AI interaction cycle: user sends message ‚Üí AI processes ‚Üí AI responds ‚Üí system waits
for next user input. Multiple API calls or tool invocations can occur within a single turn.

## System-Specific Terms

### **ClineProvider**

Core service managing task execution, API communication, and subtask coordination. Handles the main
execution loop and task lifecycle.

### **Laminar**

Observability service providing distributed tracing, metrics collection, and system monitoring
capabilities.

### **MessageQueueService**

Service managing queued user messages and ensuring proper message processing order.

### **recursivelyMakeClineRequests**

Main task execution function that handles the core AI interaction loop, including API calls, tool
invocations, and response processing.

### **Request Arbiter**

Architectural pattern providing single authority over the next action to be taken, preventing
concurrent execution conflicts.

### **Task.ts**

Core task management class containing task state, lifecycle methods, and execution coordination
logic.

## State Definitions

### **Task States**

- **CREATED**: Task initialized but not yet started
- **INITIALIZING**: Task is being set up and configured
- **RUNNING**: Task is actively executing
- **PAUSED**: Task execution temporarily suspended
- **COMPLETED**: Task finished successfully
- **FAILED**: Task encountered an error and stopped
- **TIMEOUT**: Task exceeded maximum execution time
- **ABORTED**: Task was manually stopped
- **CANCELLED**: Task was cancelled before completion
- **DESTROYED**: Task resources cleaned up

### **Session States**

- **NEW**: Session just created
- **ACTIVE**: Session actively being used
- **PAUSED**: Session temporarily inactive
- **INACTIVE**: Session not being used but still exists
- **COMPLETED**: Session finished
- **TIMEOUT**: Session exceeded maximum idle time
- **DESTROYED**: Session resources cleaned up

### **Recursive Call States**

- **IDLE**: No recursive calls active
- **RUNNING**: Single recursive call in progress
- **CONCURRENT**: Multiple recursive calls running simultaneously (race condition)
- **QUEUED**: Recursive call waiting for resources
- **LOCKED**: Recursive call blocked by synchronization
- **TIMEOUT**: Recursive call exceeded time limit
- **TRIPLE\_CONCURRENT**: Three simultaneous recursive calls (severe race condition)
