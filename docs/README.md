# KiloCode Documentation Hub

## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: This document serves as the master index and central hub for all KiloCode documentation.
- **Context**: Use this as your starting point for understanding system architecture, development workflows, and troubleshooting guides.
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️

## Research Context

This documentation hub was established through comprehensive analysis of KiloCode's system architecture, development workflows, and user needs. The documentation structure reflects findings from:

- User experience research for different types of documentation consumers
- System architecture analysis across all components and layers
- Development workflow analysis and optimization opportunities
- Critical issue investigation including race conditions and API duplication

The organization supports both immediate problem-solving and long-term system understanding.
