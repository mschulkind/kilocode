# KiloCode Documentation Hub

Welcome to the KiloCode documentation! ü¶ï This is your central hub for understanding the system architecture, development workflows, and troubleshooting guides.

## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths

- **Emergency Response**: Start with [Architecture Documentation](architecture/README.md) for critical issues and race conditions
- **Deep Dive Research**: Begin with [Documentation Standards](DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for understanding our documentation approach
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow the [Plans](plans/README.md) for active investigations and development work

### Current Focus

- API duplication race condition investigation and resolution
- Orchestrator-subtask lifecycle improvements
- Documentation standards and consolidation

## Directory Context

This directory serves as the central repository for all KiloCode documentation, following a structured approach with clear navigation paths and consistent standards. Each subdirectory provides focused coverage of specific domains while maintaining cross-references and contextual guidance. The documentation follows our established standards for discoverability, linkability, and user journey optimization.

## üîó Cross-References

- **Source Code**: See [../src/](../src/) for implementation details
- **Configuration**: See [../packages/](../packages/) for package configurations
- **Context Portal**: See [../context_portal/](../context_portal/) for ConPort integration

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of this documentation like a dinosaur fossil site - each layer tells a different part of the story, from the deep architectural foundations (like bedrock) to the surface-level user guides (like topsoil). Just as paleontologists carefully map and cross-reference different strata to understand the complete history, our documentation layers work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of the KiloCode ecosystem!
