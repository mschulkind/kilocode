## Directory Context

This directory serves as the central repository for all KiloCode documentation, following a
structured approach with clear navigation paths and consistent standards. Each subdirectory provides
focused coverage of specific domains while maintaining cross-references and contextual guidance.

### Specialized Documentation Areas
- **`architecture/`** - System design, component relationships, and architectural patterns. Contains
  critical analysis of race conditions, state machines, and repository structure. Essential for
  understanding how components interact and identifying system-level issues.
- **`orchestrator/`** - Task management, lifecycle coordination, and orchestration patterns. Focuses
  on how tasks are created, managed, and executed. Critical for understanding the main execution
  flow and subtask coordination.
- **`plans/`** - Active investigation plans and development roadmaps. Contains detailed analysis of
  current issues and proposed solutions. Use for tracking ongoing research and debugging efforts.
- **`services/`** - Individual service documentation and integration patterns. Covers specific
  services and their responsibilities within the larger system architecture.
- **`tools/`** - Tool system architecture and development guidelines. Documents how tools are
  created, integrated, and managed within the execution environment.
- **`integrations/`** - External system integrations and API patterns. Covers third-party service
  connections, data flows, and integration best practices.
- **`testing/`** - Testing strategies, frameworks, and best practices. Documents how to test various
  system components and ensure reliability.
- **`ui/`** - User interface components and interaction patterns. Covers frontend architecture, user
  experience design, and component relationships.
- **`laminar/`** - Observability and monitoring system documentation. Details the Laminar service
  for tracing, metrics, and system observability.
- **`improvements/`** - Historical improvement logs and enhancement documentation. Tracks system
  evolution, lessons learned, and technical debt management.

The documentation follows our established standards for discoverability, linkability, and user
journey optimization.

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of this documentation like a dinosaur fossil site - each layer tells a different part of the
story, from the deep architectural foundations (like bedrock) to the surface-level user guides (like
topsoil). Just as paleontologists carefully map and cross-reference different strata to understand
the complete history, our documentation layers work together to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the KiloCode ecosystem!
