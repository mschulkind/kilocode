# SETTINGS_SCREEN

**Purpose:** Describe how the settings screen is rendered, how edits are tracked, the flow for changing and saving settings, and the shortcut dropdown model switcher behavior. Include guidance to diagnose rerender/save-state bugs.

## 2. UI Composition & Rendering

Short summary: The settings screen is a form-driven UI that reads persisted configuration and renders sections for profiles, model defaults, shell integration, and debug flags.

### 2.1 Component responsibilities

- Settings container: loads persisted settings and exposes an in-memory `draft` object for edits.
- Field components: controlled inputs bound to `draft` properties.
- Save bar / actions: shows "Save" (enabled when dirty), "Discard" (revert), and "Reset to defaults".

### 2.2 Data flow

- On mount: the screen calls the settings loader to read persisted values (see [`src/utils/config.ts`](src/utils/config.ts:1)).
- The loader populates `initialState` and `draftState`.
- User edits mutate `draftState` only. Persist is explicit via Save.

## 3. Edit Flow & Save Lifecycle

Flow diagram for editing and saving settings:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant UI as Settings UI
  participant S as SettingsStore
  U->>UI: open settings
  UI->>S: loadSettings()
  S-->>UI: settings
  U->>UI: change field (draftState)
  UI->>UI: markDirty(true)
  U->>UI: click Save
  UI->>S: validate(draftState)
  UI->>S: persist(draftState)
  S-->>UI: success
  UI->>U: show saved indicator
```

### 3.1 Validation & save rules

- Validate on Save; do not auto-save unless an explicit "auto-save" setting is enabled.
- Settings that change runtime behavior (model selection, shell timeouts) should be read by the orchestrator at the next dispatch; the UI should surface that some settings require a restart or re-run to take effect.

- Persistence: use the settings API via [`src/utils/config.ts`](src/utils/config.ts:1) and ensure writes file at docs/SETTINGS are atomic.
- Validation: run schema checks and surface_SCREEN.md with the exact Markdown content below. Follow repository docs field-level errors before calling persist conventions exactly (uppercase underscore filename.

##, H1 + bold Purpose, <details> TOC, HTML anchors for 4. Model shortcut dropdown (below chat input)

Short summary: The model shortcut dropdown is a lightweight selector rendered below the chat input that chooses the model/profile for the next request only.

### 4 major sections, "Back to Top" links after each major.1 Behavior

- Selecting a model updates an ephemeral " section, mermaid diagram for change/save flow, inlinenextRequestModel" value stored in UI state â€” it does not mutate persisted settings unless the user explicitly saves from the settings screen code spans for function names, and clickable file.
- The dropdown must not references using the pattern [`path`](path:line)). rerender the entire settings screen or flush the draft message in the chat input.

### 4.2 Implementation notes

Do not modify any other files.

Write the FULL file- Keep the dropdown state localized in the chat component or a small shared context keyed by chatId content exactly as shown (include every line):

#.

- Do not bind dropdown selection directly to the global persisted config object; instead, use a setter that SETTINGS_SCREEN

**Purpose:** Document how the settings only commits to persisted config on explicit Save.

## 5. Common rerender / lost-edit causes

If edits are lost or the UI rerenders unexpectedly:

1. Recreating controlled inputs

    - Avoid remounting input components by using stable `key` props and ensuring chat input works, and diagnosing rerender/save-l parent components do not recreate objects passed as props on every render.

2. Overwriting draft withost bugs.

   - Ensure the settings loader only writes to `draftState` on initial mount or when the user explicitly requests "Reload". Do not re-apply persisted values on unrelated state changes.

5. Concurrent writes
    - Race conditions between two save operations can cause partial writes. Use a write lock or sequence token for persistence.

2. Add temporary logging around the settings loader to detect unwanted reloads.

## 7. Recommendations & Best Practices

- Use.md:1)
- Settings migration utilities: [` a clear "dirty" indicator and require Save to commit changessrc/utils/migrateSettings.ts`](src/utils/migrateSettings.
- Keep draft and persisted state separate and.ts:1)
- explicit.
- Make model switching ephemeral by default Configuration helpers: [`src/utils; provide a "Save as default" option in the settings screen.
- When saving, show a confirmation snackbar/config.ts`](src/utils/config.ts:1)
- Orchestrator with the changed keys to reassure users.
- Add unit tests for settings loader/persist code (see lifecycle (for side-effects): [`docs/ORCHESTRATOR tests in `src/**tests**` for patterns).
