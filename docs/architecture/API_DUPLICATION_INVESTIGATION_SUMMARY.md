KiloCode frequently experiences multiple API requests with spinners appearing simultaneously in the
chat view. The responses come back jumbled, confusing the chat interface. This issue:
- Occurs after many back-and-forth interactions
- Is particularly noticeable after subtask completion in the orchestrator
- Is not related to user input - happens during system processing
- Causes poor user experience and resource waste

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on existing analysis in `docs/architecture/DUPLICATE_API_REQUESTS_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md`, the
issue is a **race condition in the `ask` method** of `Task.ts` (lines 883-903).

### The Core Issue
1. **Multiple concurrent `ask` calls** can occur during task execution
2. **Each `ask` call checks for queued messages** using
   `isMessageQueued = !this.messageQueueService.isEmpty()`
3. **Multiple `ask` calls can see the same queued message** and process it simultaneously
4. **Each processing triggers `submitUserMessage`** which creates new API requests
5. **Result: Multiple API calls for the same user input**

### Key Problem Areas
- **Message Queue Race Condition**: Non-atomic `isEmpty()` and `dequeueMessage()` operations
- **Thread Safety Issues**: No synchronization for concurrent access to message queue
- **Tool Completion Concurrency**: Multiple tools calling `processQueuedMessages()` without
  coordination
- **UI State Desynchronization**: `sendingDisabled` state not properly managed

## Investigation Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Enhanced Debug Logging (IMMEDIATE)
- **Task-Level Request Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all request initiation points
- **Message Queue Instrumentation**: Atomic operations and race condition detection
- **Ask Method Instrumentation**: Detailed logging of the race-prone code section
- **ProcessQueuedMessages Instrumentation**: Synchronization and comprehensive logging

### Phase 2: UI State Monitoring (IMMEDIATE)
- **Chat UI State Tracking**: Monitor state changes and inconsistencies
- **Webview Message Handler Instrumentation**: Track message flow between UI and backend
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate requests at the UI level

### Phase 3: Orchestrator Monitoring (IMMEDIATE)
- **Subtask Completion Tracking**: Monitor subtask completion and queue processing
- **Tool Completion Instrumentation**: Standardized logging for all tools
- **Race Condition Detection**: Real-time detection of concurrent operations

### Phase 4: API Provider Tracking (IMMEDIATE)
- **Provider-Level Request Instrumentation**: Track all API requests by provider
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate requests at the provider level
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and error rates

## Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Deploy Debug Version**: Implement comprehensive debug logging
2. **Monitor System**: Collect data for 24-48 hours
3. **Analyze Patterns**: Identify specific race condition scenarios
4. **Validate Root Cause**: Confirm the existing analysis

### Fix Implementation (Week 2-3)
1. **Atomic Operations**: Replace race-prone code with thread-safe versions
2. **Synchronization**: Add proper locking mechanisms
3. **Request Deduplication**: Implement deduplication at multiple levels
4. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Testing and Validation (Week 4)
1. **Unit Tests**: Test race condition scenarios
2. **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end flows
3. **Load Tests**: Test under high concurrency
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no performance degradation

## Expected Outcomes

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- **Clear visibility** into request flow and timing
- **Reproducible test cases** for the race condition
- **Quantified impact** of the issue
- **Root cause confirmation** through data

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)
- **Zero duplicate API requests** in test scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Debug logging implementation**: Non-intrusive, easily removable
- **Monitoring deployment**: No impact on core functionality
- **Data collection**: Minimal performance overhead

### Medium Risk
- **Code changes**: Potential for introducing new bugs
- **Performance impact**: Extensive logging may slow system
- **Testing complexity**: Race conditions are hard to test

### High Risk
- **Production deployment**: Debug version in production
- **User experience**: Temporary impact during investigation
- **Timeline pressure**: Critical issue requires quick resolution

## Success Metrics

### Debugging Success
- \[ ] Able to reproduce race condition consistently
- \[ ] Clear visibility into request flow and timing
- \[ ] Identified all sources of concurrent ask calls
- \[ ] Quantified frequency and impact of the issue

### Fix Success

## Conclusion

This investigation plan provides a systematic approach to resolving the API request duplication
issue. The plan is based on existing analysis that has already identified the root cause as a race
condition in the message queue processing logic.

The implementation strategy balances thorough investigation with practical implementation, ensuring
we can quickly identify and resolve the issue while building robust monitoring for the future.
- *Key Success Factors:*\*
1. **Comprehensive logging** to understand the issue
2. **Systematic approach** to prevent missing edge cases
3. **Quick implementation** to resolve user impact
4. **Long-term monitoring** to prevent recurrence

The plan is ready for immediate implementation and should result in a complete resolution of the API
duplication issue within 2-4 weeks.
