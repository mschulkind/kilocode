## When You're Here

You're exploring the applications architecture. This document provides comprehensive information about the applications within the KiloCode system and their architecture.

## Research Context

The applications architecture was designed based on extensive research into modern application development patterns, microservices architecture, and user experience design principles.

This document provides an overview of the applications and components in the KiloCode system.

## Overview

The KiloCode system consists of multiple applications and components that work together to provide a comprehensive development environment.

## Core Applications

### Main Applications
- **Kilocode Docs** - Documentation system and viewer
- **Playwright E2E** - End-to-end testing framework
- **Storybook** - Component development and testing
- **VSCode E2E** - VSCode extension testing
- **Web Docs** - Web-based documentation
- **Web Evals** - Evaluation and testing web interface
- **Web Roo Code** - Web-based code interface

### Supporting Applications
- **VSCode Nightly** - Nightly builds and testing
- **Benchmark** - Performance benchmarking tools

## Application Architecture

Each application follows a consistent architecture pattern:

1. **Core Functionality** - Main application logic
2. **UI Components** - User interface elements
3. **Integration Layer** - External system integration
4. **Testing Framework** - Application-specific testing

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
1. Review the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)
2. Set up the development environment
3. Run the application locally
4. Follow the testing procedures

### Building Applications
- Use the centralized build system
- Follow the [Build Pipelines](BUILD_PIPELINES.md) documentation
- Implement proper testing strategies
