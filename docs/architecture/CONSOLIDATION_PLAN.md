# Documentation Consolidation Plan

Purpose: Reduce duplication across architecture docs and improve discoverability with cross-links. Items are lettered for quick selection.

## Candidates (Priority Order)

A) Race Condition Summaries

- Duplicate: High-level summaries in `race-condition/PROBLEM_OVERVIEW.md` and `API_DUPLICATION_RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md` overlap.
- Action: Keep the master index summary in `API_DUPLICATION_RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md`; shorten `PROBLEM_OVERVIEW.md` to a one-paragraph executive summary linking out.

B) Navigation Scenario Details

- Duplicate: Parent reinitialization explanations appear in `NAVIGATION_SCENARIO.md` and sprinkled in `ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md`.
- Action: Canonicalize deep detail in `NAVIGATION_SCENARIO.md`; replace secondary occurrences with a brief pointer.

C) State Machine Notes

- Duplicate: State descriptions partially restated in multiple pages.
- Action: Treat `state-machines/` as the single source; pages should link rather than restate properties.

D) Solution Options

- Duplicate: Lock vs Arbiter pros/cons appear in short guides and full recommendations.
- Action: Keep full evaluation in `SOLUTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`; short guides should link with 1‚Äì2-line summaries.

E) Testing Strategy Excerpts

- Duplicate: Test ideas copied into other pages.
- Action: Centralize in `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`; other pages link to specific sections.

F) Repository Overviews

- Duplicate: Pieces of repository context repeated in `REPOSITORY_OVERVIEW.md` and architecture index.
- Action: Keep full in repository index; architecture index retains only a 2‚Äì3 sentence description.

## Rationale

- Single-source-of-truth reduces drift and maintenance overhead.
- Readers navigate from concise indexes to canonical detail pages.
- Improves consistency during future refactors.

## Next Steps

- Apply A‚ÄìF; track follow-ups during review.
- Add a lint/check to flag long duplicate excerpts in PRs.

## üîç Research Context & Next Steps

### When You're Here, You Can:

**Understanding Architecture:**

- **Next**: Check related architecture documentation in the same directory
- **Related**: [Technical Glossary](../../GLOSSARY.md) for terminology, [Architecture Documentation](README.md) for context

**Implementing Architecture Features:**

- **Next**: [Repository Development Guide](./repository/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) ‚Üí [Testing Infrastructure](./repository/TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
- **Related**: [Orchestrator Documentation](../orchestrator/README.md) for integration patterns

**Troubleshooting Architecture Issues:**

- **Next**: [Race Condition Analysis](./race-condition/README.md) ‚Üí [Root Cause Analysis](./race-condition/ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md)
- **Related**: [Orchestrator Error Handling](../orchestrator/ORCHESTRATOR_ERROR_HANDLING.md) for common issues

### No Dead Ends Policy

Every page provides clear next steps based on your research goals. If you're unsure where to go next, return to [Architecture Documentation](README.md) for guidance.
