# Duplicate API Requests Troubleshooting (Short)

> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! üèóÔ∏è

Purpose: Fast, field-ready triage for multiple spinners / jumbled responses.

## Triage Flow

## Research Context
- *Purpose:*\* \[Describe the purpose and scope of this document]

- *Research Questions:*\* \[List key questions this document addresses]
- *Methodology:*\* \[Describe the approach or methodology used]
- *Findings:*\* \[Summarize key findings or conclusions]
- \*\*
1. Observe symptoms
- Multiple spinners at once
- Responses out of order / corrupted XML
- Often after subtask completion
2. Collect quick data
- Check DevTools/console for JSON logs with `Task.recursivelyMakeClineRequests`
- Capture reasons: main-loop | subtask-completion | user-request
- Note timestamps for overlaps
3. Identify scenario
- Two-request race: main-loop + subtask-completion close together
- Three-request race: add user-request after premature green text
4. Confirm lock status
- If lock enabled: expect no overlaps, only queued waits
- If lock disabled: expect overlaps (bug)

## Quick Fixes
- Enable lock feature flag for `recursivelyMakeClineRequests`
- Restart the chat session if corruption occurred
- If three-request variant triggered, avoid immediate resend; wait for UI to settle

## Where It Breaks
- Parent and subtask both calling `recursivelyMakeClineRequests` concurrently
- Introduced by navigation recovery change (`continueParentTask`)

## Minimal Commands / Checks
- Grep for call starts:

```bash
rg 'Task.recursivelyMakeClineRequests".*"start"' src webview-ui | cat
```
- Verify single active span per task in Laminar
- Inspect UI flags: `sendingDisabled`, `isStreaming` transitions

## Instrumentation Essentials
- Use the SHORT debug implementation: `API_DUPLICATION_DEBUG_IMPLEMENTATION_SHORT.md`
- Tag every call with `reason`
- Record `start`, `end`, `duration_ms`, `queue_wait_ms`

## Known Triggers
- Subtask completes and parent continues in background (same chat)
- Subtask prematurely thinks it's done (green text), then user resends
- Navigation away/back resumes parent (intended), but can overlap without lock

## Decision Tree
- Overlap detected?
- Yes ‚Üí Lock missing/misconfigured ‚Üí Enable lock, retest
- No ‚Üí Investigate jumbled UI rendering, ordering logic, or tool result routing
- Triple overlap?
- Yes ‚Üí Confirm premature completion; educate UI flow; add guard to suppress extra calls when
  `green end` recently emitted

## Preventive Measures
- Keep lock permanently for recursive calls
- Add idempotent guards on parent resume when already running
- CI test for overlap (see `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`)
