## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this
document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

* **Purpose**: This document covers high-impact, near-to-mid term improvements around
  task/orchestrator, recursion, session management, and API execution.
* **Context**: Use this as a starting point for understanding prioritized architecture improvements
  and strategic upgrades.
* **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems,
> this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧

## Research Context

This document was created through comprehensive analysis of architecture improvement opportunities
and strategic upgrade planning in the KiloCode project. The improvements reflect findings from:

* Architecture improvement opportunity analysis and impact assessment
* Task/orchestrator system optimization and enhancement research
* Recursion and session management improvement strategy development
* API execution optimization and performance enhancement analysis

The improvements provide strategic upgrades to complement race-condition work and enhance system
capabilities.

## Top Priorities

### Tier 0: Critical Improvements

1. **Request Arbiter** - Single authority for "what runs next"
2. **Declarative Execution Model** - Clear execution intent and flow
3. **State Machine Optimization** - Improved state management
4. **Session Management** - Enhanced session handling

### Tier 1: High-Impact Improvements

1. **Task Orchestration** - Improved task coordination
2. **Recursion Management** - Better recursion handling
3. **API Execution** - Optimized API execution flow
4. **Error Recovery** - Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

### Priority Rationale

* **Impact Assessment** - High impact on system performance and reliability
* **Implementation Complexity** - Manageable implementation complexity
* **Resource Requirements** - Reasonable resource requirements
* **Timeline Feasibility** - Achievable within planned timeline

## Strategic Improvements

### Request Arbiter Implementation

**Problem**: Multiple producers can trigger execution; a lock masks ambiguity.
**Solution**: Only one SelectedAction at a time; producers submit intents; executor runs the choice.

**Key Features:**

* **Single Authority** - Centralized execution authority
* **Intent Submission** - Producers submit execution intents
* **Choice Execution** - Executor runs the selected choice
* **Ambiguity Elimination** - Clear execution flow

### Declarative Execution Model

**Problem**: Unclear execution intent and flow.
**Solution**: Declarative execution model with clear intent and flow.

**Key Features:**

* **Clear Intent** - Explicit execution intent
* **Flow Definition** - Well-defined execution flow
* **State Management** - Improved state management
* **Error Handling** - Better error handling

### State Machine Optimization

**Problem**: Inefficient state management and transitions.
**Solution**: Optimized state machine with better performance.

**Key Features:**

* **Performance Optimization** - Improved state machine performance
* **Transition Efficiency** - Efficient state transitions
* **Memory Management** - Better memory usage
* **Scalability** - Improved scalability

### Session Management Enhancement

**Problem**: Inadequate session handling and management.
**Solution**: Enhanced session management with better reliability.

**Key Features:**

* **Session Persistence** - Reliable session persistence
* **Session Recovery** - Automatic session recovery
* **Session Security** - Enhanced session security
* **Session Performance** - Improved session performance

## Implementation Strategy
