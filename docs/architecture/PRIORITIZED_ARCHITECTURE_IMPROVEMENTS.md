# Prioritized Architecture Improvements

> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! üîß

Purpose: High-impact, near-to-mid term improvements around task/orchestrator, recursion, session
management, and API execution. Complements the race-condition work with strategic upgrades.

## Top Priorities (Tier 0‚Äì1)
1. Request Arbiter (single authority for ‚Äúwhat runs next‚Äù)
- Problem: Multiple producers can trigger execution; a lock masks ambiguity.
- Outcome: Only one SelectedAction at a time; producers submit intents; executor runs the choice.

  \[Solution Options and Synchronization Strategies]race-condition/SOLUTION\_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)
2. Parent Initialization as a First-Class Precondition
- Auto-insert InitializeParent intent gated by eligibility before any continuation.
- Ensures correctness after navigation without scattered checks.
- Link: \[Navigation Scenario and Parent Resumption Context]race-condition/NAVIGATION\_SCENARIO.md)
3. Idempotent API/Tool Execution Contract
- Idempotency keys per TaskId+Turn+Step; dedupe late arrivals/retries.
- Prevent duplicate tool side effects; single write per logical step.
4. Formal State Machines as Runtime Guards
- Promote Task/Session/RecursiveCall charts to enforce transitions at runtime.
- Reject illegal concurrent transitions; log violations.
- Link: [State Machine Index and Diagrams](README.md)
5. Single Writer Principle per TaskId
- Exactly one writer (arbiter+executor) mutates execution state; others only publish intents.

## High Priority (Tier 2)
6. Event-Sourced Task Timeline
- Append-only log of intents ‚Üí selections ‚Üí results; perfect resume and audit.
7. Standardized Reconstruction
- Canonical loader restores messages, API history, FSM, pending intents; RA resumes
  deterministically.
8. UI State Contract and Spinner Semantics
- One SelectedAction ‚Üí one spinner; queue shows pending intents; end-of-turn cooldowns.
9. Tool Invocation Envelope
- Idempotency token, deadline, cancellation; executor owns lifecycle; results via RA.
10. Observability First
- Arbiter spans: inputs, eligibility, policy, selection. Executor spans: lifecycle, idempotency.
- Link: [Observability Layer System](./OBSERVABILITY_LAYER_SYSTEM.md)

## Medium Priority (Tier 3)
11. Queue Persistence and Back-Pressure
- Durable queue per TaskId; priorities adapt under load; surface UI back-pressure.
12. Policy Engine for Priorities and Cooldowns
- Declarative policies: user > recovery > main-loop; cooldowns; burst limits; hot-reload.
13. Failure Domains and Circuit Breakers
- Isolate providers/tools; breakers on error budgets; degrade gracefully.
14. Time-Bounded Steps and Watchdogs
- Per-action deadlines; RA selects recovery/rollback on timeout.

## Low Priority (Tier 4)
15. Multi-Task Concurrency Scheduler
- Fair scheduling across tasks; per-user quotas; priority inheritance.
16. Planner Integration (Future)
- High-level planner proposes; RA selects exactly one.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Centralization (RA bottleneck) ‚Üí per-TaskId arbiters; measure latency; keep policies simple.
- Migration complexity ‚Üí staged rollout, flags, dual-path logging, shims.
- Over-constraint ‚Üí admin override policies for debugging.

## Success Metrics
- Zero concurrent recursive executions per TaskId.
- P95/P99 RA decision latency within budget.
- Idempotency dedupe rate; reduced duplicate API/tool calls.
- UX: no multiple spinners; no XML/jumbled responses.

## Suggested Rollout Plan
- Phase A: Arbiter/Executor behind flags; producers emit intents.
- Phase B: Enforce Single Writer; remove direct recursion; keep lock as fallback.
- Phase C: Idempotency keys, cooldown policies; ship spinner contract.
- Phase D: Event-sourced timeline; runtime FSM; enhanced observability.
