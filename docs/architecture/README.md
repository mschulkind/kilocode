The architecture directory contains comprehensive documentation for understanding KiloCode's system
design, component relationships, and architectural patterns. This includes critical analysis of race
conditions, state machines, repository structure, and architectural improvements. Essential for
understanding how components interact and identifying system-level issues.

### Key Focus Areas
- **System Architecture Layers** - UI, Communication, Orchestration, Provider, and Observability
  layers
- **Critical Issues & Analysis** - Race conditions, API duplication, and system reliability
- **Repository Structure** - Monorepo organization, packages, and build systems
- **State Machines** - Task, Session, and Recursive Call state management
- **Architectural Improvements** - Prioritized roadmap for system enhancements

## Directory context

This directory aggregates all architecture-focused documents: high-level overviews, layered system
design, critical issue analyses (like race conditions), and state-machine specifications. Use the
Quick Start to jump into urgent tasks or deep dives, and the Planning section to track active
architectural work. Subdirectories (e.g., `race-condition/`, `../architecture/repository/`, `state-machines/`) each
provide their own focused indexes with detailed coverage.
