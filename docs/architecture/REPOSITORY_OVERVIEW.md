# Repository Overview

**Purpose:** Master index for comprehensive information about the KiloCode repository structure, systems, and components.

> **Dinosaur Fun Fact**: Architecture documentation is like a dinosaur fossil record - each layer tells us about the evolution of our system, helping us understand how it grew and changed over time! ü¶ï

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of the repository like a dinosaur fossil site - it contains many different layers and components that tell the story of how the system evolved. Just as paleontologists carefully catalog and organize fossils by type, age, and location, we organize our code by function, purpose, and architectural layer. Each directory is like a different excavation site, revealing different aspects of the system's structure!
