## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of the repository like a dinosaur fossil site - it contains many different layers and
components that tell the story of how the system evolved. Just as paleontologists carefully catalog
and organize fossils by type, age, and location, we organize our code by function, purpose, and
architectural layer. Each directory is like a different excavation site, revealing different aspects
of the system's structure!
