Purpose: Compare Kilo’s analysis/proposal to the Roo-Code branch
`catrielmuller/fix-orchestator-load-subtask`, relative to Roo `origin/main`. Highlight base
differences, touched files, behavioral deltas, and alignment/variance with our cleanup plan.

## Repositories and Branches Compared

* Kilo: current repo (analysis/proposal live here)
* Roo: `/home/matt/code/system/Roo-Code` on branch `catrielmuller/fix-orchestator-load-subtask`
* Roo baseline: `origin/main`

## Roo Branch Diff (against origin/main)

* Branch: `catrielmuller/fix-orchestator-load-subtask`
* Files changed (top-level):
* `src/core/task/Task.ts` (modified)
* `src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts` (modified)
* `src/core/webview/__tests__/ClineProvider.stack-reconstruction.spec.ts` (added)
* `src/core/webview/__tests__/ClineProvider.taskReconstruction.spec.ts` (added)
* `.changeset/rude-pans-throw.md` (added)
* Stats: 5 files changed, 1506 insertions, 5 deletions

Inference (from paths):

* Roo mirrors the same change loci as Kilo (Task.ts, ClineProvider.ts) and adds targeted tests for
  stack/task reconstruction (good practice and a base difference vs Kilo at the time of the break).

## Conceptual Before/After (Kilo vs Roo)

Kilo (observed)

* Before: `finishSubTask` removed subtask from stack and only called `completeSubtask`.
* After: `finishSubTask` delegates to `continueParentTask`, which:
* Rehydrates parent if needed (`isInitialized` guard; load messages + API history).
* Calls `completeSubtask`.
* Background-triggers `recursivelyMakeClineRequests([], false)` if not paused.
* Side effect: can race with main loop when parent was already running (2- and 3-request variants).

Roo (observed by diff scope)

* Touches the same two core files, so likely similar structural change: parent rehydration + a
  resume call post-subtask completion.
* Adds tests around stack and task reconstruction:
* Suggests Roo codified the navigation scenario and validates reconstruction correctness.
* Minimal deletions vs large insertions indicate additive behavior (rehydration/resume) rather than
  refactors.

## Base Differences That Matter

* Tests present in Roo: Roo has specific `__tests__/ClineProvider.*` validating reconstruction; Kilo
  lacked these until our new plan.
* Naming and branch intent: Roo’s branch name is aligned with the fix; Kilo’s local changes were
  integrated without tests initially, causing regressions.
* Divergence age: Forks have evolved separately; code structure differences may exist in
  providers/services.

## Alignment With Our Cleanup Proposal

Where Roo aligns out of the box

* Parent rehydration path before continuation (seen by modified `ClineProvider.ts`).
* Recognition of reconstruction as a first-class scenario (presence of tests).

Where differences may remain

* Concurrent recursion prevention: Roo’s diff shows changes only in `Task.ts` and
  `ClineProvider.ts`. Without a central arbiter/guard, Roo may still allow concurrent calls if both
  main loop and completion trigger continuation.
* Idempotency: No evidence of an idempotency layer from the paths alone.
* Single-writer model: No new central module is present in the changed files list.
* Policy/cooldown around “green text end-of-turn”: Not evident from paths.

## Recommended Mapping of Kilo Proposal to Roo

1. Introduce a Request Arbiter (per TaskId) in Roo

* Add a new module (e.g., `src/core/execution/RequestArbiter.ts`) to own next-action selection.
* Have `ClineProvider` and `Task` submit intents instead of directly calling recursion.

2. Parent Initialization as Eligibility

* Move rehydration into arbiter/executor eligibility checks; treat it as an `initialize-parent`
  intent that always precedes continuation.

3. Idempotent Execution Keys

* Implement idempotency in Roo’s API execution layer (Task/Executor), keyed by TaskId+Turn+Reason.

4. Update and Extend Roo Tests

* Keep Roo’s reconstruction tests; add tests for:
* No concurrent recursion under concurrent producers.
* Deterministic selection under competing intents (user > recovery > subtask-completion >
  main-loop).
* Triple-request prevention when green text is emitted prematurely.

5. Observability

* Add span logs for arbiter decisions and executor lifecycle to Roo’s tracing layer.

## Side-by-Side Conceptual Diffs

ClineProvider (Kilo current vs Roo branch)

* Both: ensure parent rehydration + continuation after subtask finish.
* Kilo issue: background fire-and-forget recursion causes race in active sessions.
* Roo: likely same pattern; tests focus on reconstruction, not concurrency.

Task (Kilo vs Roo)

* Both: main loop calls recursion.
* Needed: shift to intent submission so main loop doesn’t compete with completion path.

Tests (Kilo vs Roo)

* Roo: added meaningful tests for reconstruction.
* Kilo: our plan adds both reconstruction and concurrency tests; Roo should adopt the concurrency
  suite.

## Conclusion

* Roo implemented the necessary rehydration/resume behavior and added tests around reconstruction—a
  stronger basis than Kilo had at the time of failure.
* Both codebases still need a concurrency-safe selection model. Applying the Request Arbiter +
  idempotency + eligibility gates will harmonize behavior, prevent races, and keep navigation fixes.
* Action: Port Kilo’s cleanup proposal (arbiter model, idempotency, policy) to Roo; keep Roo’s tests
  and add concurrency-specific tests.
