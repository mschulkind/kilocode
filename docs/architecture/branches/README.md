- [Branch Analysis: orchestator-load-subtask](./ORCHESTATOR_LOAD_SUBTASK_CHANGES_ANALYSIS.md)
  Dissects every notable change introduced on the `orchestator-load-subtask` branch with
  before/after code snippets. Explains motivations (navigation-driven parent resume) and highlights
  unintended concurrency side effects. Serves as the factual baseline for cleanup work.

- [Cleanup Proposal: Replace orchestator-load-subtask](./ORCHESTATOR_LOAD_SUBTASK_CLEANUP_PROPOSAL.md)
  PR-style replacement that preserves the resume behavior while preventing races by centralizing
  control in a Request Arbiter. Includes full before/after diffs, idempotency, eligibility gates,
  and a rollout/testing plan.

- [Comparison: Kilo vs Roo Subtask Resume & Orchestrator Continuation](./KILO_VS_ROO_SUBTASK_RESUME_COMPARISON.md)
  Compares Kiloâ€™s changes/proposal to Rooâ€™s `catrielmuller/fix-orchestator-load-subtask` versus
  `origin/main`. Summarizes Roo diffs, notes added reconstruction tests, identifies remaining
  concurrency risks, and maps the arbiter approach onto Roo.

- [Solution Options and Synchronization Strategies](race-condition/SOLUTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)
  Survey of approaches (locks vs arbiter) with pros/cons and test hooks.
- [Testing Strategy and Validation Plan](race-condition/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) End-to-end test plan
  for sequencing, navigation recovery, and performance.
