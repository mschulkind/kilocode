## Prevention Strategy Overview

The prevention strategy focuses on three key areas to prevent race conditions and maintain system
reliability.

### Strategy Components
1. **Code Architecture** - Designing code to prevent race conditions
2. **Monitoring and Alerting** - Detecting issues before they impact users
3. **Process and Culture** - Establishing practices to prevent future issues

### Strategic Goals

- **Prevention** - Prevent race conditions from occurring
- **Detection** - Detect issues early and quickly
- **Response** - Respond to issues effectively
- **Learning** - Learn from issues to prevent recurrence

## Code Architecture

### Architectural Principles

Design principles that prevent race conditions and ensure system reliability.

**Principle 1: Single Responsibility**

- **Component Isolation** - Isolate components to prevent interference
- **Clear Boundaries** - Define clear boundaries between components
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Minimize dependencies between components
- **Independent Operation** - Enable independent component operation

**Principle 2: Immutable State**

- **State Immutability** - Use immutable state where possible
- **State Transitions** - Handle state transitions atomically
- **State Validation** - Validate state changes
- **State Recovery** - Implement state recovery mechanisms

**Principle 3: Concurrency Control**

- **Lock Management** - Implement proper lock management
- **Atomic Operations** - Use atomic operations for critical sections
- **Deadlock Prevention** - Prevent deadlocks in concurrent operations
- **Resource Management** - Manage shared resources properly

### Design Patterns

Design patterns that prevent race conditions and improve system reliability.

**Pattern 1: Request Deduplication**

```typescript
class RequestDeduplicator {
  private requestCache = new Map<string, Promise<any>>();
  
  async executeRequest<T>(key: string, operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.requestCache.has(key)) {
      return this.requestCache.get(key);
    }
    
    const promise = operation();
    this.requestCache.set(key, promise);
    
    try {
      const result = await promise;
      return result;
    } finally {
      this.requestCache.delete(key);
    }
  }
}
```

**Pattern 2: State Machine**

```typescript
class StateMachine {
  private currentState: State;
  private transitions: Map<State, State[]>;
  
  transition(newState: State): void {
    if (!this.isValidTransition(this.currentState, newState)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid state transition');
    }
    
    this.currentState = newState;
    this.notifyStateChange(newState);
  }
  
  private isValidTransition(from: State, to: State): boolean {
    const validTransitions = this.transitions.get(from) || [];
    return validTransitions.includes(to);
  }
}
```

**Pattern 3: Circuit Breaker**

```typescript
class CircuitBreaker {
  private state: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN' | 'HALF_OPEN' = 'CLOSED';
  private failureCount = 0;
  private lastFailureTime = 0;
  
  async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (Date.now() - this.lastFailureTime > this.timeout) {
        this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');
      }
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Monitoring Strategy

Comprehensive monitoring to detect race conditions and system issues.

**Monitoring Areas:**

- **Performance Metrics** - Monitor system performance
- **Error Rates** - Track error rates and patterns

**Alert Configuration:**

```typescript
interface AlertConfig {
  metric: string;
  threshold: number;
  duration: number;
  severity: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH' | 'CRITICAL';
  notification: NotificationConfig;
}

const alertConfigs: AlertConfig[] = [
  {
    metric: 'response_time_p95',
    threshold: 1000,
    duration: 300,
    severity: 'HIGH',
    notification: { email: true, slack: true }
  },
  {
    metric: 'error_rate',
    threshold: 0.05,
    duration: 60,
    severity: 'CRITICAL',
    notification: { email: true, slack: true, pagerduty: true }
