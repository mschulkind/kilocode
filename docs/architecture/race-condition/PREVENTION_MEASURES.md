The prevention strategy focuses on three key areas:

1. **Code Architecture**: Designing code to prevent race conditions
2. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Detecting issues before they impact users
3. **Process and Culture**: Establishing practices to prevent future issues

## Code Architecture Prevention

### Design Principles

**Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear responsibility

- Task execution should be separate from task management
- API calls should be separate from business logic
- State management should be centralized

**Immutability**: Use immutable data structures where possible

- Prevent state corruption
- Make debugging easier
- Reduce side effects

**Synchronization**: Use proper synchronization mechanisms

- Locks for critical sections
- Queues for sequential processing
- Promises for async coordination

### Architectural Patterns

**Command Pattern**: Encapsulate operations as objects

```typescript
interface Command {
	execute(): Promise<void>
	undo(): Promise<void>
}

class RecursiveCallCommand implements Command {
	constructor(
		private task: Task,
		private params: RecursiveCallParams,
	) {}

	async execute(): Promise<void> {
		return await this.task.recursivelyMakeClineRequests(
			this.params.nextUserContent,
			this.params.includeFileDetails,
			this.params.reason,
		)
	}
}
```

**Observer Pattern**: Notify components of state changes

```typescript
interface TaskObserver {
	onTaskStateChange(task: Task, oldState: TaskState, newState: TaskState): void
	onRecursiveCallStart(task: Task, callId: string): void
	onRecursiveCallEnd(task: Task, callId: string): void
}

class TaskStateManager {
	private observers: TaskObserver[] = []

	addObserver(observer: TaskObserver): void {
		this.observers.push(observer)
	}

	notifyStateChange(task: Task, oldState: TaskState, newState: TaskState): void {
		this.observers.forEach((observer) => observer.onTaskStateChange(task, oldState, newState))
	}
}
```

**State Machine Pattern**: Explicit state management

```typescript
enum RecursiveCallState {
	IDLE = "idle",
	RUNNING = "running",
	QUEUED = "queued",
	LOCKED = "locked",
}

class RecursiveCallStateMachine {
	private state: RecursiveCallState = RecursiveCallState.IDLE
	private callQueue: RecursiveCallCommand[] = []

	async executeCommand(command: RecursiveCallCommand): Promise<void> {
		if (this.state === RecursiveCallState.IDLE) {
			this.state = RecursiveCallState.RUNNING
			await command.execute()
			this.state = RecursiveCallState.IDLE
		} else {
			this.callQueue.push(command)
			this.state = RecursiveCallState.QUEUED
		}
	}
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring

**Metrics to Track**:

- Race condition frequency
- API call patterns
- Response times
- Error rates
- User satisfaction

**Implementation**:

```typescript
class RaceConditionMonitor {
	private metrics = {
		totalCalls: 0,
		concurrentCalls: 0,
		raceConditions: 0,
		averageResponseTime: 0,
		errorRate: 0,
	}

	private alerts = {
		raceConditionThreshold: 1,
		responseTimeThreshold: 5000,
		errorRateThreshold: 0.05,
	}

	trackCall(callId: string, reason: string, startTime: number) {
		this.metrics.totalCalls++
		this.metrics.concurrentCalls++

		if (this.metrics.concurrentCalls > 1) {
			this.metrics.raceConditions++
			this.alert("Race condition detected", {
				callId,
				reason,
				concurrentCalls: this.metrics.concurrentCalls,
			})
		}
	}

	trackCallCompletion(callId: string, endTime: number, success: boolean) {
		this.metrics.concurrentCalls--

		if (!success) {
			this.metrics.errorRate = this.metrics.errorRate * 0.9 + 0.1
		} else {
			this.metrics.errorRate = this.metrics.errorRate * 0.9
		}

		this.updateAverageResponseTime(endTime - startTime)
	}

	private alert(message: string, context: any) {
		console.error(`[RACE_CONDITION_ALERT] ${message}`, context)

		// Send to monitoring service
		this.sendToMonitoringService({
			type: "race_condition",
			message,
			context,
			timestamp: Date.now(),
		})
	}
}
```

### Automated Detection

**Pattern Recognition**: Detect race condition patterns

```typescript
class RaceConditionDetector {
	private callPatterns = new Map<string, CallPattern>()

	analyzeCallPattern(callId: string, reason: string, timestamp: number) {
		const pattern = this.callPatterns.get(reason) || new CallPattern(reason)
		pattern.addCall(callId, timestamp)
		this.callPatterns.set(reason, pattern)

		if (pattern.isRaceCondition()) {
			this.alert("Race condition pattern detected", {
				reason,
				pattern: pattern.getSummary(),
			})
		}
	}
}

class CallPattern {
	private calls: Array<{ id: string; timestamp: number }> = []

	addCall(callId: string, timestamp: number) {
		this.calls.push({ id: callId, timestamp })
	}

	isRaceCondition(): boolean {
		// Detect if multiple calls are too close together
		const recentCalls = this.calls.filter((call) => Date.now() - call.timestamp < 1000)
		return recentCalls.length > 1
	}
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

**Response Time Tracking**: Monitor API call performance

```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
	private responseTimes: number[] = []
	private maxSamples = 1000

	trackResponseTime(duration: number) {
		this.responseTimes.push(duration)

		if (this.responseTimes.length > this.maxSamples) {
			this.responseTimes.shift()
		}

		const average = this.getAverageResponseTime()
		if (average > 5000) {
			// 5 seconds
			this.alert("High response time detected", { average })
		}
	}

	getAverageResponseTime(): number {
		return this.responseTimes.reduce((sum, time) => sum + time, 0) / this.responseTimes.length
	}
}
```
