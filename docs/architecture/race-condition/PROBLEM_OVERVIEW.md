The API duplication issue is caused by a **race condition** introduced in commit `749f3d22a` where
both the main task loop and subtask completion can simultaneously call
`recursivelyMakeClineRequests`, each making their own API request. This results in multiple
simultaneous API calls with spinners appearing in the chat interface, causing jumbled responses and
confused user experience.
- *Key Findings:*\*
- **Root Cause**: Concurrent calls to `recursivelyMakeClineRequests` from two different execution
  paths
- **Trigger**: Recent change to subtask completion handling in `ClineProvider.ts`
- **Impact**: Multiple API requests, jumbled responses, confused chat interface
- **Solution**: Synchronization mechanism to ensure only one recursive call executes at a time

> **Quantum Physics Fun Fact**: This is like having two particles in a quantum superposition - they
> can exist in multiple states simultaneously until we "observe" them (synchronize them). The key is
> knowing when to "collapse the wave function" (acquire the lock)! üî¨

## Problem Description

### Symptoms Observed
- **Multiple API requests** with spinners appearing simultaneously in chat view (2-3+ requests)
- **Jumbled responses** coming back in random order
- **Confused chat interface** with mixed-up conversation flow
- **Occurs mid-turn** after many back-and-forth interactions
- **Particularly noticeable** after subtask completion in orchestrator
- **NOT related to queued messages** - happens during active processing
- **NOT related to user input** - happens during system processing
- **3-request variant**: Sometimes 3 simultaneous requests occur, causing severe corruption
- **Green text trigger**: 3-request scenario often triggered when subtask incorrectly thinks it's
  done and outputs green text (end of turn indicator)
- **XML corruption**: After 3-request scenario, chat history becomes severely broken with XML
  appearing
- **Cascading failure**: Once 3-request scenario occurs, subsequent requests continue to be
  corrupted

### Technical Context

This issue occurs in the **orchestrator-subtask-orchestrator execution flow** where:
1. An orchestrator task creates subtasks to handle specific work
2. Subtasks execute independently and return results
3. The orchestrator processes subtask results and continues execution

### 3-Request Race Condition Variant

The most severe form of this issue involves **3 simultaneous API requests** and is triggered by a
specific sequence:
1. **Subtask Completion with Green Text**: A subtask incorrectly thinks it's done and outputs green
   text (indicating end of turn)
2. **Subtask Stops Prematurely**: The subtask stops execution even though it should continue
3. **User Sends Another Request**: User sends a new request to the agent
4. **3 Simultaneous Requests**: The system makes 3 concurrent API calls:
- Main orchestrator loop call
- Subtask completion call (from the premature completion)
- New user request call
5. **Severe Corruption**: Responses come back jumbled, causing XML to appear in chat
6. **Cascading Failure**: All subsequent requests become corrupted

This 3-request scenario is particularly destructive because:
- **XML Corruption**: Chat history becomes severely broken with XML appearing
- **Permanent Damage**: Once this occurs, the chat session is permanently corrupted
- **User Experience**: Complete breakdown of the conversation interface

## Key Concepts

### What is a Turn?

A **turn** is a complete user-AI interaction cycle:
1. **User sends a message** (user turn)
2. **AI processes and responds** (AI turn)
3. **AI outputs green text** (end of AI turn indicator)
4. **System waits for next user input**

Multiple API calls or tool invocations can occur within a single AI turn, but they're all part of
the same interaction cycle.

### What is Green Text?
- *Green text*\* is a visual indicator that appears in the chat interface to signal the end of an AI
  turn. It's like a "conversation punctuation mark" that tells the user "I'm done with my response,
  it's your turn now."

### Race Condition vs. Sequential Execution
- **Sequential Execution**: Operations happen one after another in a predictable order
- **Race Condition**: Multiple operations happen simultaneously, and the outcome depends on timing
- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple operations happen at the same time but are properly
  synchronized

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Impact
- **Confusing Interface**: Users see multiple spinners and jumbled responses
- **Lost Context**: Conversation flow becomes unclear
- **Frustration**: Users can't understand what's happening
- **Workflow Disruption**: Complex multi-step processes get interrupted

### Technical Impact
- **API Waste**: Multiple unnecessary API calls consume resources
- **Response Corruption**: Responses get mixed up and corrupted
- **State Inconsistency**: System state becomes inconsistent
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Hard to trace what's happening

### Business Impact
- **User Satisfaction**: Poor user experience affects satisfaction
- **Resource Costs**: Unnecessary API calls increase costs
- **Support Burden**: Users need help understanding what's happening
- **Development Velocity**: Time spent debugging instead of building features
