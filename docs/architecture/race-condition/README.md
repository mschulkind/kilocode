# Race Condition Analysis Documentation

Welcome to the race condition analysis documentation! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí® This directory contains detailed analysis of the API duplication race condition issue in KiloCode.

## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths

- **Something's Broken**: Start with [PROBLEM_OVERVIEW.md](PROBLEM_OVERVIEW.md)
- **Need to Understand**: Begin with [ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md](ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md)
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow [SOLUTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md](SOLUTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

### Current Focus

- API request duplication investigation
- Concurrent execution analysis
- Synchronization solutions
- State machine documentation

## üìö Documentation Structure

- **[PROBLEM_OVERVIEW.md](PROBLEM_OVERVIEW.md)** - Executive summary and problem description
  A high-level summary of the API duplication issue, key symptoms, and scenarios (including the 3-request variant). Use this for a quick situational understanding and to decide next steps.
- **[ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md](ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md)** - Detailed root cause investigation
  Explains the problematic changes, the two competing recursion paths, and the timing conditions that produce races. Includes critical code locations and reasoning about event-loop interleaving.
- **[CODE_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md](CODE_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md)** - Code flow and execution analysis
  Visualizes orchestrator ‚Üí subtask ‚Üí orchestrator transitions and API call chains. Identifies race points and ties them to specific call sites and phases.
- **[NAVIGATION_SCENARIO.md](NAVIGATION_SCENARIO.md)** - Why the problematic change was made
  Documents the navigation-away/back scenario that required rehydration and continuation. Clarifies stack reconstruction and the precise moment the parent must be reinitialized.
- **[IMPACT_ASSESSMENT.md](IMPACT_ASSESSMENT.md)** - Impact analysis and severity assessment
  Quantifies user, technical, and business impact for 2-request and 3-request variants. Provides a structured severity and risk breakdown.
- **[SOLUTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md](SOLUTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)** - Proposed solutions and implementation
  Presents lock-based, tracking-enhanced, and arbiter-based strategies with code samples and pros/cons. Recommends a hybrid path and a migration plan.
- **[TESTING_STRATEGY.md](TESTING_STRATEGY.md)** - Testing approach and validation
  Defines unit/integration/E2E/load tests to verify single-selection, navigation recovery, and no-overlap guarantees. Includes performance validations.
- **[PREVENTION_MEASURES.md](PREVENTION_MEASURES.md)** - Prevention and monitoring strategies
  Long-term design patterns (FSM enforcement, policy engine, idempotency, observability) to avoid reintroducing the class of issues.

- **Orchestrator**: See [../orchestrator/](../orchestrator/) for orchestrator-specific details
  In-depth coverage of orchestrator responsibilities, lifecycle, and best practices.

  Global entry point for architecture with repository, observability, and planning links.

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of race conditions like two dinosaurs trying to eat from the same carcass at the same time. Just as they might bump into each other and cause chaos, our concurrent API calls bump into each other and cause jumbled responses. The solution is like having a feeding hierarchy - only one dinosaur eats at a time, but they take turns in an organized way!
