Welcome to the tectonic layers of our runtime. This index describes each state machine doc and how
to use them together during design, debugging, and implementation.

## Start Here
- [Combined State Machine](COMBINED_STATE_MACHINE.md) Explains how Task, Session, and Recursive Call
  state machines interact. Use this to understand systemic behavior across boundaries. Shows
  transitions from normal execution to race conditions and back.
- [Race Condition State Machine](RACE_CONDITION_STATE_MACHINE.md) Focuses on the problem area and
  the synchronized solution. Clarifies failure modes and the expected stabilized path under
  synchronization.

## Core State Machines
- [Task State Machine](TASK_STATE_MACHINE.md) Individual task lifecycle states (CREATED ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí
  COMPLETED/FAILED). Essential for reasoning about when tasks may pause, spawn children, or resume.
- [Session State Machine](SESSION_STATE_MACHINE.md) Chat session lifecycle and
  inactivity/return-to-activity behavior. Explains how navigation and inactivity impact execution
  eligibility.
- [Recursive Call State Machine](RECURSIVE_CALL_STATE_MACHINE.md) Execution and synchronization of
  recursive API calls. Documents concurrent states and the intended single-call path.

## Combined and Specialized
- [Combined State Machine](COMBINED_STATE_MACHINE.md) A system-level view of interactions, ideal for
  onboarding and cross-team reviews.
- [Race Condition State Machine](RACE_CONDITION_STATE_MACHINE.md) The dedicated problem/solution
  chart with notes for implementation.

## Related documentation
- [API Duplication Race Condition Analysis](../API_DUPLICATION_RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md) Master
  narrative and navigation hub for the duplicate-API-request issue family.
- [Orchestrator Documentation](../../orchestrator/README.md) Parent/child task orchestration concepts
  and lifecycle.
