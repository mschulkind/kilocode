The Recursive Call State Machine manages the execution of recursive API calls, including the
detection and prevention of race conditions. This is the **"quantum field controller"** of our
system - it manages the delicate balance between order and chaos in our API calls!

> **Quantum Physics Fun Fact**: In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a "superposition" of
> states until observed. Our API calls can exist in multiple states (IDLE, RUNNING, CONCURRENT)
> until we "observe" them with proper synchronization! The key is knowing when to "collapse the wave
> function" (acquire the lock). üî¨

- **Need to understand the flow?** ‚Üí [Combined State Machine](COMBINED_STATE_MACHINE.md)
- **Ready to implement a fix?** ‚Üí Synchronization Implementation

### Key Concepts

- **IDLE** is the safe state (the "vacuum state" - empty but ready)
- **RUNNING** is normal execution (the "stable particle" - predictable)
- **CONCURRENT** is the danger zone (the "quantum entanglement gone wrong")
- **TRIPLE\_CONCURRENT** is catastrophic (the "nuclear meltdown" - XML apocalypse!)

## Recursive Call States

```typescript
// üî¨ The "quantum states" of our API calls - like particles that can exist in multiple states
// until we "observe" them (acquire a lock). This is where the magic (and chaos) happens!
enum RecursiveCallState {
	IDLE = "idle", // No recursive calls active (the "vacuum state" - empty but ready)
	RUNNING = "running", // Single recursive call active (the "stable particle" - predictable)
CONCURRENT = "concurrent", // Multiple recursive calls active (RACE CONDITION - "quantum
entanglement gone wrong")
TRIPLE_CONCURRENT = "triple_concurrent", // 3+ simultaneous calls (SEVERE RACE CONDITION - "nuclear
meltdown")
	QUEUED = "queued", // Calls queued due to lock (the "waiting room" - orderly but patient)
	LOCKED = "locked", // Lock acquired, processing (the "laboratory" - controlled environment)
	TIMEOUT = "timeout", // Lock acquisition timed out (the "failed experiment" - gave up waiting)
}

// üó∫Ô∏è The "geological survey" of our call states - what properties does each layer have?
interface RecursiveCallStateProperties {
	hasActiveCalls: boolean // Are there any calls currently running?
	hasConcurrentCalls: boolean // Are multiple calls running simultaneously? (DANGER!)
	hasTripleConcurrent: boolean // Are 3+ calls running? (CATASTROPHIC!)
	isLocked: boolean // Is the system locked for exclusive access?
	hasQueuedCalls: boolean // Are there calls waiting in the queue?
	canMakeNewCall: boolean // Can we safely start a new call?

```

## Race Condition Detection

The race condition occurs when the system transitions from `IDLE` to `CONCURRENT`, bypassing the
proper `RUNNING` state. This happens when:
1. **Main Task Loop**: Calls `recursivelyMakeClineRequests()`
2. **Subtask Completion**: Also calls `recursivelyMakeClineRequests()` via `continueParentTask()`
3. **Concurrent Execution**: Both calls reach the API simultaneously
4. **Race Condition**: Responses come back jumbled, confusing the chat interface

### 3-Request Race Condition

The most severe form involves **3 simultaneous API requests** triggered by:
1. **Subtask Premature Completion**: Subtask incorrectly thinks it's done and outputs green text
2. **Subtask Stops**: Subtask stops execution prematurely
3. **User Request**: User sends another request to the agent
4. **Triple Concurrent Calls**:
- Main orchestrator loop call
- Subtask completion call (from premature completion)
- New user request call
5. **Severe Corruption**: XML appears in chat, permanent session damage

This 3-request scenario is particularly destructive because it causes:

- **XML Corruption**: Chat history becomes severely broken
- **Permanent Damage**: Session requires restart to recover
- **Cascading Failure**: All subsequent requests become corrupted

## Synchronization States

- **QUEUED**: Calls are queued when a lock is already held
- **LOCKED**: A call is actively processing with the lock held
- **TIMEOUT**: Lock acquisition timed out, call is abandoned

## State Machine Implementation

```typescript
class RecursiveCallStateManager {
	private recursiveCallStates = new Map<string, RecursiveCallState>()
	private callLocks = new Map<string, boolean>()
	private callQueues = new Map<string, Array<() => Promise<void>>>()

	// Check if we can make a new call
	canMakeCall(taskId: string): boolean {
		const state = this.recursiveCallStates.get(taskId)
		return state === RecursiveCallState.IDLE || state === RecursiveCallState.TIMEOUT
	}

	// Acquire lock for recursive call
	async acquireLock(taskId: string, timeoutMs: number = 5000): Promise<boolean> {
		const startTime = Date.now()

		while (this.callLocks.get(taskId)) {
			if (Date.now() - startTime > timeoutMs) {
				this.recursiveCallStates.set(taskId, RecursiveCallState.TIMEOUT)
				return false
			}
			await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10))
		}

		this.callLocks.set(taskId, true)
		this.recursiveCallStates.set(taskId, RecursiveCallState.LOCKED)
		return true
	}

	// Release lock and process queue
	releaseLock(taskId: string): void {
		this.callLocks.set(taskId, false)
		this.recursiveCallStates.set(taskId, RecursiveCallState.IDLE)
		this.processQueue(taskId)
	}

	// Detect race condition
	detectRaceCondition(taskId: string): boolean {
		const state = this.recursiveCallStates.get(taskId)
		if (state === RecursiveCallState.RUNNING) {
			this.recursiveCallStates.set(taskId, RecursiveCallState.CONCURRENT)
			console.warn(`[RACE_CONDITION_DETECTED] Task ${taskId} has concurrent recursive calls`)
			return true
		}
		return false
	}
}
```

## Key States

- **IDLE**: Safe state, no active calls
- **RUNNING**: Normal execution, single call active
- **CONCURRENT**: **RACE CONDITION** - multiple calls active simultaneously
- **QUEUED**: Calls waiting for lock, synchronized execution
- **LOCKED**: Call processing with lock held

## Race Condition Prevention

To prevent race conditions:
1. **Check State**: Before making a call, check if another call is already running
2. **Acquire Lock**: Use a lock mechanism to ensure only one call at a time
3. **Queue Calls**: If lock is held, queue the call for later execution
4. **Detect Concurrent**: Monitor for concurrent calls and handle appropriately
