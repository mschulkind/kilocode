The Session State Machine manages the lifecycle of chat sessions, including user navigation, task
associations, and session inactivity.

## Session States

```typescript
enum SessionState {
	NEW = "new", // New session created
	ACTIVE = "active", // User is currently viewing
	PAUSED = "paused", // User switched away but task still running
	INACTIVE = "inactive", // No active task, needs reconstruction
	COMPLETED = "completed", // Task finished, session closed
	TIMEOUT = "timeout", // Session timed out due to inactivity
	DESTROYED = "destroyed", // Session was destroyed
}

// Session state properties
interface SessionStateProperties {
	hasActiveTask: boolean
	isUserViewing: boolean
	needsTaskReconstruction: boolean
	canResumeTask: boolean
	taskState: TaskState | null
}
```

## Session State Properties

```typescript
const SESSION_STATE_PROPERTIES: Record<SessionState, SessionStateProperties> = {
	[SessionState.NEW]: {
		hasActiveTask: false,
		isUserViewing: true,
		needsTaskReconstruction: false,
		canResumeTask: false,
		taskState: null,
	},
	[SessionState.ACTIVE]: {
		hasActiveTask: true,
		isUserViewing: true,
		needsTaskReconstruction: false,
		canResumeTask: false,
		taskState: TaskState.RUNNING,
	},
	[SessionState.PAUSED]: {
		hasActiveTask: true,
		isUserViewing: false,
		needsTaskReconstruction: false,
		canResumeTask: true,
		taskState: TaskState.PAUSED,
	},
	[SessionState.INACTIVE]: {
		hasActiveTask: false,
		isUserViewing: false,
		needsTaskReconstruction: true,
		canResumeTask: false,
		taskState: null,
	},
	[SessionState.COMPLETED]: {
		hasActiveTask: false,
		isUserViewing: false,
		needsTaskReconstruction: false,
		canResumeTask: false,
		taskState: TaskState.COMPLETED,
	},
	[SessionState.TIMEOUT]: {
		hasActiveTask: false,
		isUserViewing: false,
		needsTaskReconstruction: true,
		canResumeTask: false,
		taskState: TaskState.DESTROYED,
	},
	[SessionState.DESTROYED]: {
		hasActiveTask: false,
		isUserViewing: false,
		needsTaskReconstruction: false,
		canResumeTask: false,
		taskState: TaskState.DESTROYED,
	},
}
```

## State Transition Diagram

  NEW --> ACTIVE : startTask()
  NEW --> INACTIVE : no task started

  ACTIVE --> PAUSED : user navigates away
  ACTIVE --> COMPLETED : task completed

  PAUSED --> ACTIVE : user returns
  PAUSED --> COMPLETED : task completed while paused
  PAUSED --> INACTIVE : task failed while paused
  PAUSED --> TIMEOUT : session timeout

  INACTIVE --> ACTIVE : user starts new task
  INACTIVE --> NEW : user clears session
  INACTIVE --> TIMEOUT : session timeout

  COMPLETED --> DESTROYED : session cleanup

  TIMEOUT --> DESTROYED : session cleanup
  TIMEOUT --> ACTIVE : user resumes with reconstruction

  DESTROYED --> NEW : create new session

## State Transition Table

```typescript
const SESSION_STATE_TRANSITIONS = {
	[SessionState.NEW]: {
		startTask: SessionState.ACTIVE,
		timeout: SessionState.INACTIVE,
	},
	[SessionState.ACTIVE]: {
		navigateAway: SessionState.PAUSED,
		taskComplete: SessionState.COMPLETED,
		taskFail: SessionState.INACTIVE,
	},
	[SessionState.PAUSED]: {
		navigateBack: SessionState.ACTIVE,
		taskComplete: SessionState.COMPLETED,
		taskFail: SessionState.INACTIVE,
		timeout: SessionState.TIMEOUT,
	},
	[SessionState.INACTIVE]: {
		startTask: SessionState.ACTIVE,
		clear: SessionState.NEW,
		timeout: SessionState.TIMEOUT,
	},
	[SessionState.COMPLETED]: {
		startNew: SessionState.NEW,
		destroy: SessionState.DESTROYED,
	},
	[SessionState.TIMEOUT]: {
		destroy: SessionState.DESTROYED,
		resume: SessionState.ACTIVE,
	},
	[SessionState.DESTROYED]: {
		create: SessionState.NEW,
	},
}
```

## Key States
- **ACTIVE**: User is currently viewing the session, task is running
- **PAUSED**: User navigated away but task is still running in memory
- **INACTIVE**: No active task, needs reconstruction from history
- **COMPLETED**: Task finished, session is closed

## Session Inactivity Criteria

A session is considered inactive when:
1. **No Active Task Associated**: `!session.taskId || !session.isActive`
2. **Task Has Been Completed**: Task status is completed, failed, timeout, aborted, or cancelled
3. **User Explicitly Ended the Session**: User clicked "End Chat" or similar
4. **Session Hasn't Been Accessed Recently**: Session timeout (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity)
5. **Memory Pressure Forces Cleanup**: System needs to free memory

## Race Condition Impact

The session state machine is crucial for understanding the race condition because:
- **ACTIVE** sessions have tasks in memory that might be running
- **PAUSED** sessions can resume tasks that cause race conditions
- **INACTIVE** sessions need task reconstruction, which triggers the navigation fix
- **COMPLETED** sessions are inactive and don't cause race conditions
