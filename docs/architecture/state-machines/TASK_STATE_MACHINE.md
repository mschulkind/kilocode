The Task State Machine manages the lifecycle of individual tasks in the system, from creation to
completion or destruction. Think of it as the **"dinosaur life cycle tracker"** - we need to know if
our digital creatures are eggs, hatchlings, adults, or fossils!

> **Geology Fun Fact**: The Grand Canyon reveals 2 billion years of geological history in its
> layers. Our task states reveal the entire lifecycle of a digital task in just 10 states - much
> more efficient! üó∫Ô∏è

### Key Concepts

* **RUNNING** is where race conditions occur (the "hunting ground")
* **PAUSED** can resume and cause issues (the "hibernation that wakes up wrong")
* **COMPLETED** makes sessions inactive (the "extinction event")
* **DESTROYED** needs reconstruction (the "fossil that needs to be brought back to life")

## Task States

```typescript
// ü¶ï The "dinosaur life stages" of our tasks - from egg to extinction
enum TaskState {
	CREATED = "created", // Task created but not initialized (like a dinosaur egg)
	INITIALIZING = "initializing", // Task is being initialized (hatching process)
	RUNNING = "running", // Task is actively executing (roaming the digital plains)
	PAUSED = "paused", // Task is paused but can resume (hibernation mode)
	COMPLETED = "completed", // Task finished successfully (natural death)
	FAILED = "failed", // Task failed with error (died from disease)
	TIMEOUT = "timeout", // Task timed out (died of old age)
	ABORTED = "aborted", // Task was aborted by system (hunted by predators)
	CANCELLED = "cancelled", // Task was cancelled by user (human intervention)
	DESTROYED = "destroyed", // Task was garbage collected (fossilized)
}

// üó∫Ô∏è The "geological properties" that define each state layer
interface TaskStateProperties {
	isPaused: boolean // Is this layer currently active?
	isInitialized: boolean // Has this layer been properly formed?
	canResume: boolean // Can this layer continue its formation?
	needsReconstruction: boolean // Does this layer need to be rebuilt?
	sessionImpact: "active" | "inactive" // How does this layer affect the overall landscape?
}
```

## Task State Properties

```typescript
// üó∫Ô∏è The "geological survey" - mapping each state's characteristics
// Think of this as our "rock identification guide" for different task formations
const TASK_STATE_PROPERTIES: Record<TaskState, TaskStateProperties> = {
	// ü•ö CREATED: The "dinosaur egg" state - not yet hatched
	[TaskState.CREATED]: {
		isPaused: false, // Not paused, just not started
		isInitialized: false, // Still in the shell
		canResume: false, // Can't resume what hasn't started
		needsReconstruction: false, // Fresh and new
		sessionImpact: "active", // Session is ready for action
	},

	// üê£ INITIALIZING: The "hatching" process
	[TaskState.INITIALIZING]: {
		isPaused: false, // Actively hatching
		isInitialized: false, // Still in process
		canResume: false, // Can't resume mid-hatch
		needsReconstruction: false, // Building from scratch
		sessionImpact: "active", // Session is preparing
	},

	// ü¶ï RUNNING: The "roaming the plains" state - this is where the magic happens!
	[TaskState.RUNNING]: {
		isPaused: false, // Actively hunting (executing)
		isInitialized: true, // Fully formed and ready
		canResume: false, // Already running, no need to resume
		needsReconstruction: false, // Built and operational
		sessionImpact: "active", // Session is fully engaged
	},

	// üò¥ PAUSED: The "hibernation" state - can wake up anytime
	[TaskState.PAUSED]: {
		isPaused: true, // Sleeping but alive
		isInitialized: true, // Fully formed before sleep
		canResume: true, // Can wake up and continue
		needsReconstruction: false, // Still intact in memory
		sessionImpact: "active", // Session is still active
	},

	// üíÄ COMPLETED: The "natural death" - successful life cycle
	[TaskState.COMPLETED]: {
		isPaused: true, // No longer active
		isInitialized: false, // Memory cleared
		canResume: false, // Can't bring back the dead
		needsReconstruction: true, // Need to rebuild from fossils (history)
		sessionImpact: "inactive", // Session becomes inactive
	},

	// ü¶† FAILED: The "disease" state - something went wrong
	[TaskState.FAILED]: {
		isPaused: true, // Stopped due to error
		isInitialized: false, // State corrupted
		canResume: false, // Can't resume from failure
		needsReconstruction: true, // Need to rebuild from scratch
		sessionImpact: "inactive", // Session becomes inactive
	},

	// ‚è∞ TIMEOUT: The "old age" state - ran out of time
	[TaskState.TIMEOUT]: {
		isPaused: true, // Stopped due to timeout
		isInitialized: false, // State expired
		canResume: false, // Can't resume expired task
		needsReconstruction: true, // Need to rebuild
		sessionImpact: "inactive", // Session becomes inactive
	},

	// ü¶Ö ABORTED: The "predator attack" - system killed it
	[TaskState.ABORTED]: {
		isPaused: true, // Forcibly stopped
		isInitialized: false, // State destroyed
		canResume: false, // Can't resume aborted task
		needsReconstruction: true, // Need to rebuild
		sessionImpact: "inactive", // Session becomes inactive
	},

	// üö´ CANCELLED: The "human intervention" - user stopped it
	[TaskState.CANCELLED]: {
		isPaused: true, // User stopped it
		isInitialized: false, // State cleared
		canResume: false, // Can't resume cancelled task
		needsReconstruction: true, // Need to rebuild
		sessionImpact: "inactive", // Session becomes inactive
	},

	// ü¶¥ DESTROYED: The "fossilized" state - garbage collected
	[TaskState.DESTROYED]: {
		isPaused: true, // Completely inactive
		isInitialized: false, // Memory freed
		canResume: false, // Can't resume destroyed task
		needsReconstruction: true, // Need to rebuild from fossils
		sessionImpact: "inactive", // Session becomes inactive
	},
}
```

		destroy: TaskState.DESTROYED,
	},
	[TaskState.INITIALIZING]: {

	[TaskState.TIMEOUT]: {

	[TaskState.ABORTED]: {
		destroy: TaskState.DESTROYED,
	},
	[TaskState.CANCELLED]: {
		destroy: TaskState.DESTROYED,
	},
	[TaskState.DESTROYED]: {
		reconstruct: TaskState.INITIALIZING,
	},
}
```

## Key States

* **RUNNING**: Main execution state where task is actively processing
* **PAUSED**: Task is paused but can be resumed from memory
* **COMPLETED**: Task finished successfully, session becomes inactive
* **DESTROYED**: Task was garbage collected, needs reconstruction from history

## Race Condition Impact

The task state machine is crucial for understanding the race condition because:

* **RUNNING** tasks can have concurrent recursive calls

* **PAUSED** tasks can be resumed and cause race conditions

* **DESTROYED** tasks need reconstruction, which triggers the navigation fix

* **COMPLETED** tasks make sessions inactive, requiring different handling
