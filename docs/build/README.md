## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this
document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: This document covers \[DOCUMENT PURPOSE BASED ON FILE PATH].
- **Context**: Use this as a starting point or reference while navigating the project.
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why"
> behind the "what"! 💻

Welcome to the build system documentation! 🏗️ This directory contains comprehensive information
about how KiloCode is built, packaged, and deployed.

## Research Context

### Technical Overview

**Component**: \[Component name]
**Version**: \[Version number]
**Architecture**: \[Architecture description]
**Dependencies**: \[Key dependencies]

### Background

\[Background information about the topic]

### Methodology

\[Research or development methodology used]

## 🗺️ Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths

- **Something's Broken**: Start with [Build pipeline architecture](BUILD_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
  for troubleshooting and system context.
- **Need to Understand**: Review this README’s structure section for an overview and links.
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow the build pipeline from source to deployment.

### Current Focus
- Build pipeline architecture and optimization
- Deployment strategies and configurations
- Build performance monitoring

## 📚 Documentation Structure

- **[Build pipeline architecture](BUILD_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Detailed architecture of the
  build system including tooling and CI.

## Directory context

This directory documents how the monorepo is built and shipped across packages, apps, and the VS
Code extension. It explains tooling, CI/CD workflows, and deployment strategies, and provides
guidance for debugging and optimizing builds. Use the quick start paths to jump into common tasks.

## 🔗 Cross-References

- **Architecture**: See [This resource](../architecture/) for system architecture
- **Services**: See [Parent directory](../services/) for build-related services
- **Standards**: See [Parent directory](../standards/) for documentation standards

## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of the build system like a dinosaur's digestive system - it takes raw materials (source code),
processes them through various stages (compilation, bundling, testing), and produces the final
output (packaged extension). Just like how different dinosaurs had different digestive systems
optimized for their diet, our build system is optimized for TypeScript, React, and VS Code
extensions!
