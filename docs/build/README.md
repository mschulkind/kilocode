# Build System Documentation

> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why" behind the "what"! 💻

Welcome to the build system documentation! 🏗️ This directory contains comprehensive information about how KiloCode is built, packaged, and deployed.

## 🗺️ Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths
- **Something's Broken**: Start with [Build pipeline architecture](BUILD_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for troubleshooting and system context.
- **Need to Understand**: Review this README’s structure section for an overview and links.
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow the build pipeline from source to deployment.

### Current Focus
- Build pipeline architecture and optimization
- Deployment strategies and configurations
- Build performance monitoring

## 📚 Documentation Structure
- **[Build pipeline architecture](BUILD_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Detailed architecture of the build system including tooling and CI.

## Directory context

This directory documents how the monorepo is built and shipped across packages, apps, and the VS Code extension. It explains tooling, CI/CD workflows, and deployment strategies, and provides guidance for debugging and optimizing builds. Use the quick start paths to jump into common tasks.

## 🔗 Cross-References
- **Architecture**: See [Architecture Documentation](../../architecture/) for system architecture
- **Services**: See [Services Documentation](../../services/) for build-related services
- **Standards**: See [Standards Documentation](../../standards////////) for documentation standards

## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of the build system like a dinosaur's digestive system - it takes raw materials (source code), processes them through various stages (compilation, bundling, testing), and produces the final output (packaged extension). Just like how different dinosaurs had different digestive systems optimized for their diet, our build system is optimized for TypeScript, React, and VS Code extensions!
