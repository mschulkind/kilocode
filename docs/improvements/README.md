## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: This document covers \[DOCUMENT PURPOSE BASED ON FILE PATH].
- **Context**: Use this as a starting point or reference while navigating the project.
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! üèóÔ∏è

Welcome to the improvements documentation! üöÄ This directory tracks technical debt, research gaps,
and priority improvements for the KiloCode project.

## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths

- **Something's Broken**: Check [TECHNICAL\_DEBT.md](TECHNICAL_DEBT.md) for known issues
- **Need to Understand**: Start with [Repository Overview](README.md) for an overview
- **Research Journey**: Explore [RESEARCH\_GAPS.md](RESEARCH_GAPS.md) for areas needing investigation

### Current Focus
- API duplication race condition investigation
- Documentation standards implementation
- System architecture improvements

## üìö Documentation Structure

- **[Repository Overview](README.md)** - Master index of all improvement-related documentation
- **[PRIORITY\_IMPROVEMENTS.md](PRIORITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md)** - High-priority improvements and fixes
- **[RESEARCH\_GAPS.md](RESEARCH_GAPS.md)** - Areas requiring further research
- **[TECHNICAL\_DEBT.md](TECHNICAL_DEBT.md)** - Known technical debt and refactoring needs

## üîó Cross-References

- **Architecture**: See [../architecture/](../architecture/) for system architecture issues
- **Plans**: See [../../plans/](../../plans/) for investigation plans
- **Standards**: See [../standards/](../standards/) for documentation improvements

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of technical debt like sediment layers in a fossil bed - each layer represents a different era
of development decisions. Some layers are well-preserved (good architecture), while others show
signs of erosion (technical debt). Our job is to carefully excavate and preserve the good while
cleaning up the problematic layers!
