# Improvements Documentation

Welcome to the improvements documentation! üöÄ This directory tracks technical debt, research gaps, and priority improvements for the KiloCode project.

## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths

- **Something's Broken**: Check [TECHNICAL_DEBT.md](TECHNICAL_DEBT.md) for known issues
- **Need to Understand**: Start with [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) for an overview
- **Research Journey**: Explore [RESEARCH_GAPS.md](RESEARCH_GAPS.md) for areas needing investigation

### Current Focus

- API duplication race condition investigation
- Documentation standards implementation
- System architecture improvements

## üìö Documentation Structure

- **[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)** - Master index of all improvement-related documentation
- **[PRIORITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md](PRIORITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md)** - High-priority improvements and fixes
- **[RESEARCH_GAPS.md](RESEARCH_GAPS.md)** - Areas requiring further research
- **[TECHNICAL_DEBT.md](TECHNICAL_DEBT.md)** - Known technical debt and refactoring needs

## üîó Cross-References

- **Architecture**: See [../architecture/](../architecture/) for system architecture issues
- **Plans**: See [../../plans/](../../plans/) for investigation plans
- **Standards**: See [../standards/](../standards/) for documentation improvements

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of technical debt like sediment layers in a fossil bed - each layer represents a different era of development decisions. Some layers are well-preserved (good architecture), while others show signs of erosion (technical debt). Our job is to carefully excavate and preserve the good while cleaning up the problematic layers!
