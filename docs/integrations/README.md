# Integrations Documentation

## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this
document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: This document serves as the master index for all external integration documentation
in the KiloCode project.
- **Context**: Use this as a starting point for understanding how KiloCode connects with external
systems and tools.
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why"
behind the "what"! üíª

## Research Context

This documentation directory was established through comprehensive analysis of KiloCode's external
integration requirements and capabilities. The structure reflects findings from:
- Integration architecture analysis across all external systems
- User experience research for different development environments
- Performance analysis of integration patterns
- Security assessment of external system connections

The organization supports both immediate integration setup and long-term integration strategy
planning.

## Integration Overview

Welcome to the integrations documentation! This directory covers all external integrations and how
KiloCode connects with other systems. Each integration is designed to seamlessly connect KiloCode
with different development environments and tools.

## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers

- **Editor Setup**: Check [Editor Integration Guide](EDITOR_INTEGRATION.md) for VS Code and editor
setup
- **JetBrains Users**: Review [JetBrains Plugin Documentation](JETBRAINS_PLUGIN.md) for IDE
integration
- **Terminal Workflow**: See [Terminal Integration Guide](TERMINAL_INTEGRATION.md) for shell
integration
- **Browser Automation**: Explore [Browser Automation Documentation](BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md) for web
interaction capabilities

### For System Administrators

- **Service Integration**: Review [Tree-sitter Service Documentation](TREE_SITTER_SERVICE.md) for
parsing service setup
- **Architecture Overview**: Check [Integration Architecture](../architecture/README.md) for system
design
- **Security Considerations**: See [Integration Standards](../standards/README.md) for security
guidelines

## Documentation Structure

### Core Integration Documents

- **[Editor Integration Guide](EDITOR_INTEGRATION.md)** - VS Code and editor integration with setup
instructions and troubleshooting
- **[JetBrains Plugin Documentation](JETBRAINS_PLUGIN.md)** - JetBrains IDE plugin with installation
and configuration
- **[Terminal Integration Guide](TERMINAL_INTEGRATION.md)** - Terminal and shell integration with
command reference
- **[Browser Automation Documentation](BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md)** - Browser automation capabilities
with usage examples
- **[Tree-sitter Service Documentation](TREE_SITTER_SERVICE.md)** - Tree-sitter parsing service with
API reference

### Integration Relationships

Each integration document cross-references related integrations and provides navigation paths to
related documentation. This creates a comprehensive integration ecosystem rather than isolated
guides.

## Current Focus Areas

### Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)
- Editor integration optimization for VS Code
- JetBrains plugin stability improvements
- Terminal integration performance enhancement

### Strategic Initiatives (Month 1-3)
- Browser automation reliability improvements
- Tree-sitter service scalability
- Integration security hardening

## Cross-References

### Related Documentation

- **Architecture**: [Integration Architecture](../architecture/README.md) for system design
- **Services**: [Integration Services](../services/README.md) for service-specific documentation
- **Standards**: [Integration Standards](../standards/README.md) for quality guidelines

### Implementation Context

- **Tools**: [Development Tools](../tools/README.md) for implementation guidance
- **Testing**: [Testing Infrastructure](../testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for integration testing
