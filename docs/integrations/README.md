## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of integrations like the complex ecosystem relationships between dinosaurs and their
environment. Just as different dinosaurs had specialized adaptations for different environments
(aquatic, terrestrial, aerial), our integrations are specialized for different development
environments (editors, terminals, browsers). Each integration is like a different species, perfectly
adapted to its specific niche!
