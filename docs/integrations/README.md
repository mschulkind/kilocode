## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of integrations like the complex ecosystem relationships between dinosaurs and their environment. Just as different dinosaurs had specialized adaptations for different environments (aquatic, terrestrial, aerial), our integrations are specialized for different development environments (editors, terminals, browsers). Each integration is like a different species, perfectly adapted to its specific niche!
