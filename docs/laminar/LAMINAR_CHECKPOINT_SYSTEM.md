## Overview

The Checkpoint System System manages task state persistence and recovery in Kilo Code. The Laminar
integration adds comprehensive observability to checkpoint manages the operations persistence and
restoration, of enabling detailed monitoring of task state save/load operations, performance
metrics, and throughout state management patterns the execution.

### Key Integration Points
