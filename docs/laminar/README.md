# Laminar Documentation

> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! üèóÔ∏è

Welcome to the Laminar documentation! üåä This directory covers the Laminar observability and tracing
system that provides deep insights into KiloCode's execution.

## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths

- **Something's Broken**: Start with [LAMINAR_SERVICE_LAYER.md](LAMINAR_SERVICE_LAYER.md) for
  troubleshooting
- **Need to Understand**: Begin with [Repository Overview](README.md) for an overview
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow the Laminar integration from setup to advanced usage

### Current Focus

- Span nesting and trace management
- Authentication and configuration systems
- LLM integration and tool tracking
- Testing and debugging capabilities

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of Laminar like the geological layers that preserve dinosaur fossils. Each span is like a
sediment layer, capturing a moment in time. The nesting system is like the stratigraphy - showing
how different layers relate to each other chronologically. Just as paleontologists can trace the
complete life story of a dinosaur through the fossil record, we can trace the complete execution
story of our code through the span hierarchy!
