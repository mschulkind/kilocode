- *Purpose:*\* This document outlines the Kilo Code Orchestrator's strategies for handling errors,
ensuring resilience, and maintaining a stable operational state. It covers error detection, recovery
  mechanisms, and the "Mistake Limit" concept.

> **Dinosaur Fun Fact**: Error handling is like a dinosaur's immune system - it detects threats
> (errors), isolates them (recovery mechanisms), and learns from them (mistake limits) to become
> stronger over time! ü¶ï

### Error Handling Philosophy

<a id="error-handling-philosophy"></a>

The orchestrator is designed to be self-correcting where possible. The core philosophy is that
errors are a natural part of a complex, model-driven workflow. Instead of failing immediately, the
system attempts to recover by providing the error context back to the language model.

Key principles:

- **Informative Feedback**: Errors are not just caught; they are formatted into a clear, descriptive
  message that is fed back into the task's execution loop.
- **Model-Led Recovery**: The language model is responsible for attempting to correct its own
  mistakes. If it tries to use a tool with incorrect parameters, the resulting error message should
  guide it to fix the call in its next attempt.
- **Finite Retries**: To prevent infinite loops of failure, the system employs a "Mistake Limit" to
  halt tasks that are repeatedly failing.

### Types of Errors

<a id="types-of-errors"></a>

- **Tool Execution Errors**: The most common type. These occur when a tool fails to execute.
  Examples include:
- Invalid parameters (e.g., wrong file path).
- Runtime exceptions within the tool's logic.
- I/O failures.
- **Parsing Errors**: The model produces malformed XML for a tool call that the `StreamingParser`
  cannot understand.
- **Permission Errors**: The model attempts to use a tool that is not allowed in the current mode.
  The primary example is [`FileRestrictionError`](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L157).
- **Catastrophic Errors**: Unrecoverable system-level errors that immediately halt the task.

### The Recovery Loop

<a id="the-recovery-loop"></a>

When a recoverable error occurs, the orchestrator does not terminate the task. Instead, it treats
the error as the "result" of the attempted tool call.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant TaskEngine
    participant ToolExecutor
    participant Model

    TaskEngine->>ToolExecutor: Execute Tool(params)
    ToolExecutor-->>TaskEngine: ERROR: Invalid parameters!
    Note over TaskEngine: Error is caught and formatted.
    TaskEngine->>Model: Send Updated Context (including error message)
    Model->>Model: Analyze error and formulate corrected tool call
    Model-->>TaskEngine: New Tool Call (with corrected params)
    TaskEngine->>ToolExecutor: Execute Corrected Tool
    ToolExecutor-->>TaskEngine: Success!
```

This loop allows the model to learn from its mistakes within the context of a single task.

### The "Mistake Limit"

<a id="the-mistake-limit"></a>

To prevent a task from getting stuck in a perpetual failure loop, the `Task` engine maintains a
mistake counter.

- **Increment**: The counter is incremented every time a tool execution error occurs.
- **Threshold**: There is a pre-defined limit for the number of mistakes allowed within a single
  task.
- **Termination**: If the mistake counter exceeds the threshold, the task is immediately terminated,
  and a failure state is reported to the user. This prevents wasted resources and provides a clear
  signal that the current approach is not working.
- **Reset**: The counter is reset upon successful tool execution, giving the model a "clean slate"
  after a successful recovery.

This concept is a crucial guardrail that ensures system stability.

### Specific Error Scenarios

<a id="specific-error-scenarios"></a>

#### Scenario: `FileRestrictionError`
1. **Action**: Model in `architect` mode attempts to call `write_to_file`.
2. **Check**: The `ToolExecutor` consults the `Mode & Permission Service` via
   [`isToolAllowedForMode`](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L167). The check fails.
3. **Error**: A [`FileRestrictionError`](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L157) is thrown.
4. **Recovery**: The error message, explaining that `write_to_file` is not allowed in `architect`
   mode, is passed back to the model.
5. **Correction**: The model should then use a tool like
   [`switchModeTool`](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L8) to change to `code` mode before re-attempting
   the file write.

#### Scenario: Invalid Regex in `search_files`
1. **Action**: Model calls `search_files` with a malformed regex pattern.
2. **Error**: The tool's implementation catches the regex compilation error and returns an error
   result.
3. **Recovery**: The error message, "Invalid regex pattern: \[details]", is sent to the model.
4. **Correction**: The model should fix the regex pattern in its next attempt.
