> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why"
> behind the "what"! üíª

- *Purpose:*\* This document provides guidance on how to extend the capabilities of the Kilo Code
  Orchestrator. It covers the primary extension points: adding new tools, creating custom modes, and
  defining workspace-specific rules.

> **Cartography Fun Fact**: This documentation is like a map - it shows you where you are, where you
> can go, and how to get there without getting lost! üó∫Ô∏è

### Extensibility Philosophy

<a id="extensibility-philosophy"></a>

The orchestrator is designed to be a flexible framework, not a fixed system. Extensibility is a core
tenant, allowing developers to tailor the orchestrator's capabilities to specific project needs or
to integrate with external services.

The primary extension vectors are:

- **Tools**: Adding new actions the orchestrator can perform.
- **Modes**: Defining new operational contexts with unique permission sets.
- **Rules**: Providing project-specific instructions and constraints to the model.

### Adding New Tools (Gap)

<a id="adding-new-tools-gap"></a>

Adding a new tool allows the orchestrator to perform novel actions, such as calling a third-party
API or interacting with a proprietary build system.

While the detailed implementation process is still being finalized, the general workflow will
involve:
1. **Implementation**: Creating a TypeScript function that encapsulates the tool's logic. This
   function must be robust and provide clear error messages on failure.
2. **Registration**: Registering the new tool with the `ToolExecutor` so that it can be discovered
   and invoked.
3. **Documentation**: Generating a schema that describes the tool's purpose, parameters, and return
   values. This schema is used for both validation and for informing the model on how to use the
   tool.
4. **Permissioning**: Assigning the new tool to one or more modes to control its availability.

This section is marked as a **Gap** and will be updated as the formal process is solidified.

### Adding New Modes (Gap)

<a id="adding-new-modes-gap"></a>

Creating a new mode allows for the definition of a new security context, tailored for a specific
type of task.

The process for adding a new mode is currently under development. The anticipated steps are:
1. **Definition**: Defining the new mode's name, purpose, and slug in the central mode registry,
   likely [`src/shared/modes.ts`](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L69).
2. **Permission Assignment**: Creating a mapping that links the new mode to a specific set of
   allowed tools.
3. **File Access Policy**: Optionally defining a file access policy that restricts the mode's
   read/write capabilities to certain file patterns.

This section is marked as a **Gap**. Further details will be provided once the API for mode creation
is finalized.

### Adding Custom Rules

<a id="adding-custom-rules"></a>

This is the most straightforward way to extend and guide the orchestrator's behavior on a
per-project basis. The system is designed to load `.md` files from a `.kilocode/rules` directory in
the workspace root.

These rule files are injected directly into the system prompt via
[`getSystemPrompt`](../../src/core/task/Task.ts#L2499). They can contain any information that helps
guide
the model, such as:
- "Do not use the `any` type in TypeScript."
- "All new components must be registered in `src/components/index.ts`."
- "API calls to the billing service must be routed through the `BillingAPIClient`."

For a complete overview of how these rules are discovered and loaded, please refer to the
[Documentation Guide](../DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md).
