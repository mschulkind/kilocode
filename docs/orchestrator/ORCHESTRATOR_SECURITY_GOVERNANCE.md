### Security Philosophy

<a id="security-philosophy"></a>

The orchestrator's security model is based on the principle of **least privilege**. By default, a
task has limited capabilities. Its permissions are elevated based on the specific `Mode` it is
operating in. This ensures that the powerful tools, especially those that interact with the file
system, are only used when explicitly required for the task at hand.

This mode-centric approach provides a clear and auditable trail of why certain actions were
permitted.

### Modes as a Security Boundary

<a id="modes-as-a-security-boundary"></a>

Modes are the primary security mechanism in the orchestrator. Each mode defines a specific context
and a corresponding set of allowed actions. The definitions for these modes and their capabilities
are located in [`src/shared/modes.ts`](../../src/shared/modes.ts#L69).

Examples of modes and their intended privilege levels:

- **`architect`**: High-level planning and structuring. Typically has no file system write access.
- **`code`**: Implementation and file modification. Has broad access to file system tools.
- **`debug`**: Investigation and analysis. May have read access to most files but limited write
  access.
- **`test`**: Running and creating tests. Has access to test runners and can write to test files.

A task can request to change its mode by using the
[`switchModeTool`](../../src/core/tools/switchModeTool.ts#L8), but this is an explicit, logged
action.

### Tool Permissioning

<a id="tool-permissioning"></a>

Before any tool is executed, the `ToolExecutor` performs a permission check. This is handled by the
[`isToolAllowedForMode`](../../src/shared/modes.ts#L167) function.

This function checks a mapping that associates each mode with a list of allowed tool names or
patterns.
- If the tool is in the allowed list for the current mode, execution proceeds.
- If the tool is not in the list, the function returns `false`, and the `ToolExecutor` throws a
  permission error.

Some tools, like `askFollowupQuestionTool`, are considered **Always-Available Tools** and are
permitted in all modes.

### File Access Control

<a id="file-access-control"></a>

In addition to tool-level permissions, modes can also define file access policies. This is a more
granular level of control that restricts which files can be read or written, even by permitted tools
like `write_to_file`.

This is enforced through file path pattern matching. For example, the `test` mode might only be
allowed to write to files matching `*.test.ts` or `__mocks__/*.ts`.

When a tool attempts to access a file that violates the current mode's file access policy, a
[`FileRestrictionError`](../../src/shared/modes.ts#L157) is thrown. This error is specific and
clearly
communicates the nature of the violation to the model, allowing it to take corrective action (e.g.,
switching to an appropriate mode).

This diagram shows the decision-making process for executing a tool call.
