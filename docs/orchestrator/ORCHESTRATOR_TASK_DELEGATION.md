> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid
> foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! üèóÔ∏è

* *Purpose:*\* This document explains the mechanism and strategy behind task delegation in the Kilo
  Code Orchestrator. It covers how complex problems are decomposed into smaller, manageable subtasks
  and the lifecycle of those subtasks.

> **Cartography Fun Fact**: This documentation is like a map - it shows you where you are, where you
> can go, and how to get there without getting lost! üó∫Ô∏è

### The Philosophy of Delegation

<a id="the-philosophy-of-delegation"></a>

The orchestrator's task delegation capability is a form of recursive problem decomposition. Instead
of attempting to solve a large, multi-faceted problem in a single, long-running task, the system can
break it down into a series of smaller, more focused subtasks.

This approach has several advantages:

* **Isolation**: Subtasks have their own context and history, preventing prompt contamination and
  allowing the model to focus on a specific goal.
* **Specialization**: A subtask can be initiated in a different `Mode` than its parent, granting it
  access to a specialized set of tools. For example, a `code` mode task could delegate to a `test`
  mode subtask.
* **Resilience**: An error in a subtask does not automatically fail the parent task. The parent can
  decide how to proceed based on the subtask's result.
* **Clarity**: It creates a clear, hierarchical structure for complex work, which is easier to debug
  and manage.

### The Subtask Mechanism

<a id="the-subtask-mechanism"></a>

Task delegation is facilitated by a pair of specialized tools:

1. **`startSubtask`**: This tool is called by the model when it identifies a piece of work that
   should be handled in isolation. It pauses the current (parent) task and initiates a new (child)
   task.
2. **`completeSubtask`**: This tool is called by the child task when its objective is complete. It
   terminates the child task and returns its result to the waiting parent task, which then resumes
   its own execution loop.

The parent task is effectively in an `awaiting_subtask` state while the child task is active.

### Subtask Workflow Diagram

    participant ParentTask
    participant ToolExecutor
    participant ChildTask

    ParentTask->>ToolExecutor: Execute startSubtask(instructions)
    activate ParentTask
    Note over ParentTask: State: awaiting_subtask
    ToolExecutor->>ChildTask: Instantiate & Initiate
    activate ChildTask

    ChildTask->>ChildTask: Run its own lifecycle (tool calls, etc.)

    ChildTask->>ToolExecutor: Execute completeSubtask(result)
    deactivate ChildTask

    ToolExecutor-->>ParentTask: Return subtask result
    deactivate ParentTask
    Note over ParentTask: State: in_progress
    ParentTask->>ParentTask: Continue execution with result
```

### Key Symbols and Their Roles

<a id="key-symbols-and-their-roles"></a>

* [`startSubtask`](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L1628): The entry point for delegation. This function
  is responsible for pausing the parent task and creating the new child `Task` instance. It takes
  the instructions for the new subtask as an argument.
* [`completeSubtask`](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L1669): The exit point for a subtask. This function
  packages the subtask's final output and signals the parent task to resume its operation.
* **`newTaskTool`**: While not strictly for subtasks, the
  [`newTaskTool`](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L14) can be used to fire off independent, asynchronous
  tasks that do not block the parent. This is useful for "fire and forget" operations where the
  result is not immediately needed.

### When to Use Subtasks

<a id="when-to-use-subtasks"></a>

The decision to delegate is made by the language model based on the complexity of the task at hand.
Common scenarios for delegation include:

* **Mode Switching for a Specific Action**: A task in `architect` mode needs to write code. It
  delegates to a subtask in `code` mode to perform the file modifications.
* **Complex Queries**: A task needs to gather information from multiple sources. It can delegate a
  subtask for each source to run in parallel (if the architecture supports it) or sequentially.
* **Refactoring**: A large-scale refactoring task can be broken down into subtasks for each file or
  module that needs to be changed.
* **Verification Steps**: A task can delegate to a `test` mode subtask to run verification checks on
  the code it has just written.
