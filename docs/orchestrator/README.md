> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid
> foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! üèóÔ∏è

Welcome to the **conductor's podium** of our system! The orchestrator is like the maestro of a
digital symphony - it coordinates all the different instruments (tasks) to create beautiful music
(functionality). But sometimes, like a conductor with too many musicians playing at once, things can
get chaotic!

> **Geology Fun Fact**: The orchestrator is like the "continental drift" of our system - it moves
> large pieces (tasks) around, and sometimes the plates don't align properly, causing seismic
> activity (race conditions)! üåç

## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this
document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: \[Brief description of what this document covers]
- **Audience**: \[Who should read this document]
- **Prerequisites**: \[What you should know before reading]
- **Related Documents**: \[Links to related documentation]

## Directory Context

The orchestrator directory contains comprehensive documentation for understanding KiloCode's task
management, lifecycle coordination, and orchestration patterns. This includes core orchestrator
system architecture, lifecycle management, extensibility patterns, and security governance. Critical
for understanding how tasks are created, managed, and executed within the main execution flow and
subtask coordination.

### Key Focus Areas

- **Core Orchestrator System** - Architecture, lifecycle management, and state handling
- **Architecture & Design** - Design principles, extensibility, and security patterns
- **Implementation Guidelines** - Best practices for orchestrator development and integration
- **Specialized Features** - Advanced orchestration capabilities and patterns

## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Map

### Core Concepts

- **[Orchestrator Lifecycle](ORCHESTRATOR_LIFECYCLE.md)** - How the conductor manages the symphony
  Describes initialization, running, pausing, subtask spawning, waiting, and completion. Shows when
  control moves between parent and child tasks and where continuation points live. Use this to trace
  execution over time.
- **[Orchestrator Index](../orchestrator/ORCHESTRATOR_INDEX.md)** - The complete score of our
  orchestration system
  High-level map of orchestrator responsibilities, interfaces, and integration points. Links to
  lifecycle, tools, delegation, and error-handling pages. Start here for a complete understanding
  before diving deeper.

### Quick Start Paths

#### üéµ **Understanding the Symphony** (How It Works)

- *For Expert Engineers New to KiloCode:*\*
1. **Start Here**: [Technical Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) - Essential terminology (Orchestrator, Task,
   Subtask, etc.)
2. **System Overview**: [Orchestrator Index](../orchestrator/ORCHESTRATOR_INDEX.md) - High-level
   architecture and
   responsibilities
3. **Deep Dive**: [Orchestrator Lifecycle](ORCHESTRATOR_LIFECYCLE.md) - Detailed execution patterns
   and state management
4. **Current Issues**: [Race Condition Analysis](architecture/README.md) - API
   duplication problems

#### üö® **Emergency Response** (Something's Broken!)
1. **Quick Diagnosis**: [Race Condition Analysis](architecture/README.md) -
   Current API duplication issues
2. **Understand Flow**: [Orchestrator Lifecycle](ORCHESTRATOR_LIFECYCLE.md) - Execution patterns and
   state transitions
3. **Find Solutions**: [State Machines](architecture/README.md) - Behavior
   modeling and fixes
4. **Implementation**:
   [Solution Recommendations](architecture/SOLUTION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md) - Detailed
   fixes

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of the orchestrator like different types of dinosaurs:

- **Main Orchestrator** = **Tyrannosaurus Rex** - The apex predator, always running and hunting
  (executing tasks)
- **Subtask** = **Velociraptor** - Fast, coordinated, but can cause chaos when they swarm
- **Task Coordination** = **Brontosaurus** - The gentle giant, managing the overall environment

When they work together, it's like a well-coordinated dinosaur pack. When they don't... well, that's
when we get our race condition "extinction event"!

## üî¨ Research Areas

### Current Focus

- **3-Request Race Condition**: The "meteor impact" that causes mass extinction (session corruption)
- **Green Text Trigger**: The "volcanic eruption" that starts the chain reaction
- **Synchronization**: The "evolutionary adaptation" needed to survive

### Next Steps
1. **Map the exact sequence** of orchestrator-subtask interactions during race conditions
2. **Design the synchronization mechanism** to prevent concurrent access
3. **Implement monitoring** to detect when we're approaching a "mass extinction event"

## üéØ Key Concepts

### The Problem

The orchestrator creates subtasks, but when they complete, both the main orchestrator and the
subtask completion can trigger API calls simultaneously, causing a race condition.

### The Solution

We need to synchronize these calls so only one can execute at a time, like a conductor ensuring only
one section of the orchestra plays at a time.
