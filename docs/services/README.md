# Services Documentation

> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why" behind the "what"! üíª

Welcome to the services documentation! ‚öôÔ∏è This directory covers all the microservices and service
layers that power KiloCode's functionality.

## Directory Context

The services directory contains comprehensive documentation for understanding KiloCode's service
layer architecture and patterns. This includes core services (cloud, authentication, AI
interaction), AI & ML services (prompt systems, code indexing), integration services (external APIs,
data flows), and specialized services (monitoring, observability). Essential for understanding how
individual services operate within the larger system architecture.

### Key Focus Areas

- **Core Services** - Cloud authentication, prompt systems, and code indexing
- **AI & ML Services** - AI interaction, context management, and semantic search
- **Integration Services** - External API connections and data flow patterns
- **Specialized Services** - Monitoring, observability, and system-specific services

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of services like the different organ systems in a dinosaur's body. Each service is like a
specialized organ - the code index service is like the brain (memory and retrieval), the cloud
services are like the circulatory system (transporting data), and the marketplace is like the
digestive system (processing and distributing resources). Just as dinosaurs needed all their organ
systems working together to survive, our system needs all services working in harmony!
