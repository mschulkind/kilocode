# Services Documentation

Welcome to the services documentation! ⚙️ This directory covers all the microservices and service layers that power KiloCode's functionality.

## 🗺️ Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths

- **Something's Broken**: Check specific service docs for troubleshooting
- **Need to Understand**: Start with [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) for an overview
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow service architecture and integration guides

### Current Focus

- Cloud services architecture
- Code indexing and search services
- Custom modes and prompt systems
- MCP integration and marketplace

## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of services like the different organ systems in a dinosaur's body. Each service is like a specialized organ - the code index service is like the brain (memory and retrieval), the cloud services are like the circulatory system (transporting data), and the marketplace is like the digestive system (processing and distributing resources). Just as dinosaurs needed all their organ systems working together to survive, our system needs all services working in harmony!
