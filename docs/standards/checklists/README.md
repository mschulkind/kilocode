## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of checklists like the systematic excavation process used by paleontologists. Just as they have checklists for each step of the excavation (marking the site, photographing, cataloging, preserving), we have checklists for each step of the documentation process (writing, reviewing, validating, publishing). Each checklist ensures we don't miss any important steps!
