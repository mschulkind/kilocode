## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this
document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: This document covers \[DOCUMENT PURPOSE BASED ON FILE PATH].
- **Context**: Use this as a starting point or reference while navigating the project.
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why"
> behind the "what"! üíª

- *Purpose:*\* Comprehensive standards for documenting code, data structures, and technical content
  to
  ensure clarity, maintainability, and accessibility for all users.

> **Biology Fun Fact**: Just like how DNA contains the genetic code that determines how living
> organisms function, our code documentation contains the "genetic code" that determines how our
> software functions - and just like DNA, it needs to be well-organized and clearly documented to be
> useful! üß¨

- *Required for complex data structures*\*:
- Enum values MUST have explanatory comments with their purpose and context
- Interface properties MUST be documented with their relationships and constraints
- State properties tables MUST include inline explanations for each property
- Code snippets MUST be broken down with contextual comments

### Comment Format

- *Standard Format*\*: Use consistent comment formatting throughout

```typescript
// üéØ Purpose: Brief explanation of what this represents
// üîó Context: How it relates to other concepts
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Key constraints or gotchas
enum ExampleState {
	VALUE1 = "value1", // Specific explanation of this state
	VALUE2 = "value2", // Another explanation
}
```

### Comment Types

- *Purpose Comments*\*: Explain what the code does **Context Comments**: Explain how it relates to
  other concepts **Constraint Comments**: Explain limitations and requirements **Example Comments**:
  Provide usage examples

- *Implementation*\*:

```typescript
// üéØ Purpose: Manages the lifecycle of individual tasks in the system
// üîó Context: Part of the core task management system
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Task state changes trigger events that other components listen to
enum TaskState {
	CREATED = "created", // Task created but not initialized (like a dinosaur egg)
	INITIALIZING = "initializing", // Task is being initialized (hatching process)
	RUNNING = "running", // Task is actively executing (roaming the digital plains)
	PAUSED = "paused", // Task is paused but can resume (hibernation mode)
	COMPLETED = "completed", // Task finished successfully (natural death)
	FAILED = "failed", // Task failed with error (died from disease)
	TIMEOUT = "timeout", // Task timed out (died of old age)
	ABORTED = "aborted", // Task was aborted by system (hunted by predators)
	CANCELLED = "cancelled", // Task was cancelled by user (human intervention)
	DESTROYED = "destroyed", // Task was garbage collected (fossilized)
}
```

const TASK_STATE_PROPERTIES: Record<TaskState, TaskStateProperties> = {
	// ü•ö CREATED: The "dinosaur egg" state - not yet hatched
	[TaskState.CREATED]: {

- **Purpose**: What the structure represents

- **Relationships**: How it relates to other structures

- **Constraints**: Limitations and requirements

- **Examples**: Valid values and usage examples

### Documentation Format

- *Standard Format*\*: Use consistent documentation format

```typescript
// üéØ Purpose: The "geological properties" that define each state layer
// üîó Context: Used by the task management system to determine behavior
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: These properties control how tasks behave in different states
interface TaskStateProperties {
	isPaused: boolean // Is this layer currently active?
	isInitialized: boolean // Has this layer been properly formed?
	canResume: boolean // Can this layer continue its formation?
	needsReconstruction: boolean // Does this layer need to be rebuilt?
	sessionImpact: "active" | "inactive" // How does this layer affect the overall landscape?
}
```

### Property Documentation

- *Each Property Must Include*\*:

- **Purpose**: What the property represents

- **Type**: Data type and constraints

- **Relationships**: How it relates to other properties

- **Examples**: Valid values and usage

- *Implementation*\*:

```typescript
// üéØ Purpose: Manages the execution of recursive API calls
// üîó Context: Part of the core API call management system
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This enum controls the synchronization of API calls
enum RecursiveCallState {
	IDLE = "idle", // No recursive calls active (the "vacuum state" - empty but ready)
	RUNNING = "running", // Single recursive call active (the "stable particle" - predictable)
CONCURRENT = "concurrent", // Multiple recursive calls active (RACE CONDITION - "quantum
entanglement gone wrong")
TRIPLE_CONCURRENT = "triple_concurrent", // 3+ simultaneous calls (SEVERE RACE CONDITION - "nuclear
meltdown")
	QUEUED = "queued", // Calls queued due to lock (the "waiting room" - orderly but patient)
	LOCKED = "locked", // Lock acquired, processing (the "laboratory" - controlled environment)
	TIMEOUT = "timeout", // Lock acquisition timed out (the "failed experiment" - gave up waiting)
}

// üó∫Ô∏è The "geological survey" of our call states - what properties does each layer have?
interface RecursiveCallStateProperties {
	hasActiveCalls: boolean // Are there any calls currently running?
	hasConcurrentCalls: boolean // Are multiple calls running simultaneously? (DANGER!)
	hasTripleConcurrent: boolean // Are 3+ calls running? (CATASTROPHIC!)
	isLocked: boolean // Is the system locked for exclusive access?
	hasQueuedCalls: boolean // Are there calls waiting in the queue?
	canMakeNewCall: boolean // Can we safely start a new call?
	raceConditionRisk: boolean // Is there a risk of race conditions?
	severeCorruptionRisk: boolean // Is there a risk of severe corruption? (XML apocalypse!)
}
```

## Code Examples

- *Purpose*\*: Provide practical, real-world examples that demonstrate concepts and usage.

### Example Requirements

- *Every Code Example Must Include*\*:

- **Context**: What the example demonstrates

- **Purpose**: Why this example is useful

- **Explanation**: How the code works

- **Usage**: How to use the example

### Example Format

- *Standard Format*\*: Use consistent format for all examples

```typescript
// üéØ Purpose: Example of how to implement lock-based synchronization
// üîó Context: This example shows how to prevent race conditions in API calls
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is a simplified example - production code would need more error handling

class RecursiveCallManager {
	private callLocks = new Map<string, boolean>()
	private recursiveCallStates = new Map<string, RecursiveCallState>()

	// üéØ Purpose: Acquire a lock for a specific task to prevent concurrent calls
	// üîó Context: Called before making API requests to ensure only one call at a time
	// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Returns false if lock cannot be acquired within timeout
	async acquireLock(taskId: string, timeoutMs: number = 5000): Promise<boolean> {
		const startTime = Date.now()

		// Wait for lock to become available or timeout
		while (this.callLocks.get(taskId)) {
			if (Date.now() - startTime > timeoutMs) {
				this.recursiveCallStates.set(taskId, RecursiveCallState.TIMEOUT)
				return false
			}
			await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10))
		}

		// Acquire the lock
		this.callLocks.set(taskId, true)
		this.recursiveCallStates.set(taskId, RecursiveCallState.LOCKED)
		return true
	}

	// üéØ Purpose: Release a lock after API call completion
	// üîó Context: Called after API request completes to allow next call
	// ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Must be called even if API call fails to prevent deadlock
	async releaseLock(taskId: string): Promise<void> {
		this.callLocks.set(taskId, false)
		this.recursiveCallStates.set(taskId, RecursiveCallState.IDLE)
	}
}
```
