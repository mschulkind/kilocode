# Linking Policy üîó

> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together -
> documentation helps us understand how! ‚öôÔ∏è

* *Purpose:*\* Comprehensive standards for creating and maintaining links within KiloCode
  documentation, ensuring consistent navigation and discoverability across all documents.

> **Cartography Fun Fact**: The word "cartography" comes from the Greek words "chartis" (map) and
> "graphein" (to write). Our linking policy is like the "cartographic principles" that guide how we
> map the relationships between different pieces of information! üó∫Ô∏è

## Executive Summary

* Effective linking creates a web of knowledge that helps users understand relationships and
  discover
  related information. These standards ensure consistent, functional, and valuable links throughout
  our documentation.\*

* *Key Standards:*\*

* **Doc-to-Doc Links**: Use relative paths within the `docs/` directory

* **Code References**: Use absolute repo-root paths for code files

* **External Links**: Use absolute HTTPS URLs for external references

* **Link Quality**: All links must be descriptive, functional, and valuable

## Link Types and Rules

### Doc-to-Doc Links

* *Rule*\*: Use relative paths within the `docs/` directory. Do NOT prefix with `docs/`.

* *Examples*\*:

```markdown
# From root docs/

> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together -
documentation helps us understand how! ‚öôÔ∏è

[System Overview](architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) [Standards Guide](README.md)

```

## Link Quality Standards

### Descriptive Link Text

* *Good Examples*\*:

```markdown
[API Duplication Analysis](architecture/API_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md)
[State Machine Design](README.md)
[ask method in Task.ts](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L739)
[Anthropic API Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/api)
```

* *Bad Examples*\*:

```markdown
[View details](architecture/API_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md)
[more info](README.md) [this file](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L739)
[Docs.anthropic.com Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/api)
```

### Link Value

* *Every link must add value*\*:

* **Contextual**: Links should be relevant to the current content

* **Informative**: Links should provide additional useful information

* **Actionable**: Links should help users accomplish their goals

* **Current**: Links should point to up-to-date information

### Link Integrity

* *Functional Requirements*\*:

* **Working**: All links must resolve to valid destinations

* **Stable**: Links should not break when content moves

* **Accessible**: Links should work for all users and tools

* **Maintainable**: Links should be easy to update and maintain

## GitHub-Specific Considerations

* *Markdown Renderer*\*: All links will be viewed on GitHub.com, so ensure they work in the GitHub
  markdown renderer.

* *Supported Features*\*:

* **Relative Links**: GitHub supports relative links within the repository

* **Code References**: Line numbers create clickable links to specific lines

* **Table of Contents**: Anchors work automatically in GitHub's markdown viewer

* **Image Links**: Both relative and absolute image links are supported

* *Unsupported Features*\*:

* **Reference-style Links**: Avoid `[ref]: url` pattern

* **Custom HTML**: Stick to standard markdown

* **JavaScript**: No interactive elements

* **Custom CSS**: No styling beyond markdown

* *GitHub Link Examples*\*:

```markdown
# These work in GitHub

> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems,
this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! üîß

[API Analysis](architecture/API_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md)

* *Update Triggers*\*:

* **File Moves**: Update all links when files are moved or renamed

* **Content Changes**: Update links when referenced content changes

* **External Changes**: Check external links for availability and relevance

* **Structure Changes**: Update links when directory structure changes

### Link Testing

* *Manual Testing*\*:

* Click all links to verify they work

* Check that links point to the intended content

* Verify that external links are still accessible

* Test links with different tools and browsers

* *Automated Testing*\*:

* Use link checking tools to identify broken links

* Set up CI/CD checks for link integrity

* Monitor external link availability

* Track link usage and effectiveness

## Common Mistakes

### Path Mistakes

```

* *Code Reference Examples*\*:

```markdown
The `recursivelyMakeClineRequests` method in [Task.ts](`[FILE_MOVED_OR_RENAMED]`#L1790) is called
from both the main task loop and subtask completion, creating a race condition when both execute
simultaneously.
