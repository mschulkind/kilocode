## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of engagement like the colorful plumage of a peacock - it's not just functional, it's designed
to capture attention and communicate effectively. Just as different dinosaurs had different ways of
attracting mates or warning predators (bright colors, elaborate crests, distinctive calls), our
documentation uses different engagement techniques to attract and retain readers!
