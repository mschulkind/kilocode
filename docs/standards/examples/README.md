## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of examples like the fossil specimens in a museum - they show you what good documentation
looks like in practice. Just as a museum displays different types of fossils (complete skeletons,
partial remains, fossilized footprints) to help visitors understand different aspects of
paleontology, our examples show different types of documentation (complete guides, partial examples,
code snippets) to help you understand different aspects of technical writing!
