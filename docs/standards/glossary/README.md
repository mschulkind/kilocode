# Technical Glossary

> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️

Welcome to the technical glossary! 📚 This directory contains definitions and explanations of
technical terms used throughout the KiloCode documentation.

## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of the glossary like a paleontologist's field guide - it helps you identify and understand the
different "species" of technical concepts you'll encounter. Just as a field guide helps you
distinguish between different types of dinosaurs (herbivores vs. carnivores, different time periods,
different habitats), our glossary helps you distinguish between different types of technical
concepts (data structures vs. functions, different architectural layers, different execution
contexts)!
