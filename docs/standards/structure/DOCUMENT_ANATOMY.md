## Problem Description

The issue manifests as multiple API requests with spinners appearing simultaneously in the chat
interface.

### Symptoms
- Multiple API requests with spinners
- Jumbled responses in chat interface
- Confused user experience

### Impact
- Degraded user experience
- Potential data corruption
- System instability

## Root Cause Analysis

The race condition occurs when both the main task loop and subtask completion call
`recursivelyMakeClineRequests` simultaneously.

### Technical Details

The issue is introduced in commit `749f3d22a` where subtask completion triggers a recursive call to
the parent task.

## Executive Summary

_The API duplication issue is caused by a race condition where multiple API calls are made
simultaneously, resulting in jumbled responses and confused user experience. This document provides
a comprehensive analysis of the problem, identifies the root cause, and recommends solutions for
implementation._

## Problem Description

The issue manifests as multiple API requests with spinners appearing simultaneously in the chat
interface.

### Symptoms
- Multiple API requests with spinners
- Jumbled responses in chat interface
- Confused user experience

### Impact
- Degraded user experience
- Potential data corruption
- System instability

## Root Cause Analysis

The race condition occurs when both the main task loop and subtask completion call
`recursivelyMakeClineRequests` simultaneously.

### Technical Details

The issue is introduced in commit `749f3d22a` where subtask completion triggers a recursive call to
the parent task.

## Solution Recommendations

Implement a synchronization mechanism to ensure only one recursive call executes at a time.

### Implementation Strategies
1. **Simple Lock-Based**: Use a mutex to prevent concurrent calls
2. **Enhanced with Call Tracking**: Track call state and queue additional calls
3. **Subtask Completion Coordination**: Coordinate subtask completion with main loop

## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to implement the solution:
1. **Add Synchronization**: Implement lock-based synchronization
2. **Add Logging**: Add comprehensive debug logging
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Create automated tests for race conditions
4. **Monitor Performance**: Ensure solution doesn't impact performance
