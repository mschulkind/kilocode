this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! üîß

## Major section heading (H2 - Sentence case)

This section covers the main topic.

### Subsection heading (H3 - Sentence case)

This subsection covers a specific aspect.

#### Enumerated list (H4 - Only for tight scope)
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Another subsection (H3 - Sentence case)

This subsection covers another aspect.

## Another major section (H2 - Sentence case)

This section covers another main topic.

## Navigation Footer

* *Required*\*: Every document MUST include a navigation footer at the end with the anchor
  `<a id="navigation-footer"></a>`.

* *Standard Format*\*:

```
<a id="navigation-footer"></a>
- Back: [`PARENT_README.md`](PARENT_README.md) ¬∑ Root: [`README.md`](README.md) ¬∑ Source:
`/docs/FILENAME.md#L1`

* *Link Requirements*\*:

1. **Back**: Link to parent index (relative path)
2. **Root**: Link to main [`README.md`](README.md) (relative path)
3. **Source**: Link to source file (absolute repo-root path with `#L1`)

* *Footer Examples*\*:

```markdown
# From root docs/

## Structure Validation

* *Pre-Submission Checks*\*: Validate document structure before submitting.

* *Required Elements*\*:

* \[ ] Single H1 at top

* \[ ] Purpose statement with `**Purpose:**` format

* \[ ] Collapsible TOC present (if required)

* \[ ] Headings follow H1‚ÜíH2‚ÜíH3 hierarchy

* \[ ] Navigation footer present and correct

* *Structure Quality*\*:

* \[ ] Purpose statement is clear and specific

* \[ ] TOC includes all H2 and H3 sections

* \[ ] Headings use correct case (H1 Title Case, H2/H3 Sentence case)

* \[ ] Navigation footer links are correct and functional

* \[ ] Document follows logical flow and organization

## Common Mistakes

* *Structure Mistakes*\*:

* ‚ùå Multiple H1 headings in one document

* ‚ùå Missing purpose statement

* ‚ùå TOC includes H4 entries

* ‚ùå Missing navigation footer

* ‚ùå Incorrect heading case

* *Content Mistakes*\*:

* ‚ùå Purpose statement doesn't match content

* ‚ùå TOC doesn't match actual headings

* ‚ùå Navigation footer links are broken

* ‚ùå Inconsistent heading hierarchy

* ‚ùå Missing required elements

* *Examples*\*:

# API Duplication Analysis

- *Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of the API duplication race condition, including root cause
identification, impact assessment, and solution recommendations.

</details>

## Executive Summary

_The API duplication issue is caused by a race condition where multiple API calls are made
simultaneously, resulting in jumbled responses and confused user experience._

## Problem Description

The issue manifests as multiple API requests with spinners appearing simultaneously in the chat
interface.

### Symptoms
- Multiple API requests with spinners
- Jumbled responses in chat interface
- Confused user experience

### Impact
- Degraded user experience
- Potential data corruption
- System instability

## Root Cause Analysis

The race condition occurs when both the main task loop and subtask completion call
`recursivelyMakeClineRequests` simultaneously.

### Technical Details

The issue is introduced in commit `749f3d22a` where subtask completion triggers a recursive call to
the parent task.

## Solution Recommendations

Implement a synchronization mechanism to ensure only one recursive call executes at a time.

### Implementation Strategies
1. **Simple Lock-Based**: Use a mutex to prevent concurrent calls
2. **Enhanced with Call Tracking**: Track call state and queue additional calls
3. **Subtask Completion Coordination**: Coordinate subtask completion with main loop

## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to implement the solution:
1. **Add Synchronization**: Implement lock-based synchronization
2. **Add Logging**: Add comprehensive debug logging
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Create automated tests for race conditions
4. **Monitor Performance**: Ensure solution doesn't impact performance
