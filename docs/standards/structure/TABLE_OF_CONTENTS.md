## Executive Summary

## Research Context

- *Purpose:*\* Define standards for table of contents (TOC) creation and formatting to improve
  document navigation and discoverability across all KiloCode documentation.

- *Background:*\* Inconsistent TOC formatting and missing TOCs in longer documents were making it
  difficult for users to navigate and find information efficiently.

- *Research Questions:*\* What format should TOCs use? When are TOCs required? What content should
be
  included?

- *Methodology:*\* Analysis of documentation length patterns, user navigation needs, and markdown
best
  practices to determine optimal TOC standards.

- *Findings:*\* Collapsible format with H2/H3 entries only, required for documents with 3+ H2s and
  800+ words, provides optimal navigation without cluttering shorter documents.
- \*\*
- Table of contents elements provide essential navigation for readers, helping them understand
  document structure and quickly locate specific information. These standards ensure consistent TOC
  formatting and content across all KiloCode documentation.\*

- *Key Standards:*\*

- **Format**: Collapsible `<details><summary>` format

- **Content**: Include H2 and H3 entries only

- **Placement**: Immediately after purpose statement

- **Optional**: Skip TOC for documents with <3 H2s and <800 words

## TOC Requirements

- *Required Elements*\*: Every document that meets the criteria MUST include a TOC.

- *TOC Criteria*\*:

- **H2 Count**: Document has 3 or more H2 sections

- **Word Count**: Document is 800 words or more

- **Content Complexity**: Document covers multiple distinct topics

- **Navigation Value**: TOC would help readers navigate content

- *TOC Format*\*: Use the standard collapsible format:

```markdown
<details><summary>Table of Contents</summary>
- [Section 1](#section-1)
- [Section 2](#section-2)
- [Subsection 2.1](#subsection-21)
- [Subsection 2.2](#subsection-22)
- [Section 3](#section-3)

</details>
```

## Format Standards

- *Collapsible Format*\*: Use `<details><summary>Table of Contents</summary>` format.

- *Benefits*\*:

- **Space Efficient**: Doesn't take up space when collapsed

- **User Controlled**: Users can expand/collapse as needed

- **Consistent**: Standard format across all documents

- **Accessible**: Works with screen readers and other tools

- *Format Structure*\*:

```markdown
<details><summary>Table of Contents</summary>
- [Executive Summary](#executive-summary)
- [Section 1](#section-1)
- [Section 2](#section-2)
- [Subsection 2.1](#subsection-21)
- [Subsection 2.2](#subsection-22)
- [Section 3](#section-3)

</details>
```

- *Format Elements*\*:

- **Opening Tag**: `<details><summary>Table of Contents</summary>`

- **List Items**: `- [Section Name](#section-anchor)`

- **Closing Tag**: `</details>`

- **Indentation**: Use consistent indentation for readability

## Content Guidelines

- *Include H2 and H3 Entries*\*: TOC should include all H2 and H3 sections.

- *Exclude H4 Entries*\*: Do not include H4 entries in the TOC.

- *Anchor Links*\*: Use proper anchor links that match heading text.

- *Anchor Format*\*: Convert heading text to anchor format:

- **Lowercase**: Convert to lowercase

- **Hyphens**: Replace spaces with hyphens

- **Special Characters**: Remove special characters

- **Numbers**: Keep numbers as-is

- *Anchor Examples*\*:

```markdown
# Heading Text ‚Üí #heading-text

## Section Name ‚Üí #section-name

### Subsection Title ‚Üí #subsection-title

## API Duplication Analysis ‚Üí #api-duplication-analysis

### Root Cause Analysis ‚Üí #root-cause-analysis
```

- *Content Examples*\*:

```markdown
<details><summary>Table of Contents</summary>

## Executive Summary

_The API duplication issue is caused by a race condition where multiple API calls are made
simultaneously._

## Problem Description

The issue manifests as multiple API requests with spinners appearing simultaneously in the chat
interface.

### Symptoms
- Multiple API requests with spinners
- Jumbled responses in chat interface
- Confused user experience

### Impact
- Degraded user experience
- Potential data corruption
- System instability

## Root Cause Analysis

The race condition occurs when both the main task loop and subtask completion call
`recursivelyMakeClineRequests` simultaneously.

### Technical Details

The issue is introduced in commit `749f3d22a` where subtask completion triggers a recursive call to
the parent task.

### Code Analysis

The problematic code is located in the `ask` method of `Task.ts`.

## Solution Recommendations

Implement a synchronization mechanism to ensure only one recursive call executes at a time.

### Implementation Strategies

This section covers different approaches to solving the problem.

### Performance Considerations

Ensure the solution doesn't impact system performance.

## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to implement the solution:
1. **Add Synchronization**: Implement lock-based synchronization
2. **Add Logging**: Add comprehensive debug logging
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Create automated tests for race conditions
4. **Monitor Performance**: Ensure solution doesn't impact performance

## Testing Strategy

Create comprehensive tests to validate the solution.

## Performance Considerations

Ensure the solution doesn't impact system performance.

## Common Mistakes

Common mistakes to avoid when implementing the solution.

## Implementation Examples

Examples of how to implement the solution.
