## Overview

This document defines the validation rules for standardized document templates to ensure consistent
structure and eliminate validation warnings across all documentation. The validation system
automatically checks documents against these rules to maintain high quality and consistency
throughout the KiloCode project documentation.

The template validation system is designed to:
- Ensure all documents follow consistent structural patterns
- Eliminate common validation warnings and errors
- Improve document quality and readability
- Provide clear guidance for document creation and maintenance
- Support automated quality assurance processes

## Validation Implementation

### Template Compliance Checking

The validation system checks:
1. Document type detection based on path and content
2. Required sections presence
3. Section content requirements
4. Link text descriptiveness
5. Navigation structure
6. Line length compliance
7. Fun fact presence (warning only)

### Error Handling

- **Errors**: Missing required sections, invalid structure
- **Warnings**: Missing recommended sections, non-descriptive links
- **Info**: Suggestions for improvement

### Performance Requirements
- Template validation must complete within 30 seconds
- Must handle documents up to 1MB in size
- Must provide clear error messages with suggestions

## Best Practices

### Document Creation
1. Choose appropriate template based on document type
2. Fill in all required sections
3. Use descriptive link text
4. Include relevant fun facts
5. Ensure proper navigation structure

### Maintenance
1. Keep templates up to date
2. Validate against template rules
3. Update cross-references when moving documents
4. Maintain consistent formatting

### Quality Assurance
1. Run template validation before committing
2. Check for broken links
3. Verify navigation structure
4. Ensure compliance with standards

## Examples

### Good Example - Navigation Document

```markdown
# Getting Started Guide

## When You're Here

This document provides a comprehensive getting started guide for new users.

- **Purpose**: Help new users understand the system and get up and running quickly
- **Context**: Essential for onboarding new team members
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics

> **Onboarding Fun Fact**: Studies show that good documentation can reduce onboarding time by 60%!

## Research Context

### Project Information

**Name**: KiloCode System  
**Type**: Development Tool  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: Node.js, TypeScript  
**Risk Level**: Low

## No Dead Ends Policy

This document connects to:
- [Installation Guide](./installation.md) - Step-by-step installation instructions
- [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md) - System configuration options
- [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions

Guide](../tools/DOCUMENTATION_BEST_PRACTICES.md)

### Bad Example - Missing Required Sections

```markdown
# Getting Started Guide

This document helps new users get started.

## Installation

[Content without required sections...]
```

This would fail validation due to missing "When You're Here", Research Context, and other required
sections.

## Migration Guide

### Converting Existing Documents
1. **Identify Document Type**: Use the DocumentTypeDetector to determine the appropriate template
2. **Add Required Sections**: Add missing required sections following the template structure
3. **Update Navigation**: Ensure proper navigation structure and links
4. **Validate**: Run template validation to ensure compliance
5. **Test**: Verify all links work and document is properly structured

### Common Issues and Fixes

- **Missing "When You're Here"**: Add the section with purpose, context, and navigation info
- **Missing Research Context**: Add section with project information and background
- **Missing Navigation Footer**: Add footer with back links and related topics
- **Non-descriptive Links**: Update link text to be more descriptive
- **Missing Fun Facts**: Add relevant fun facts to improve engagement

## Updates and Maintenance

This validation system is maintained as part of the KiloCode documentation automation. Updates to
template rules should be:
1. Documented in this file
2. Implemented in the validation system
3. Tested with sample documents
4. Applied to existing documentation

For questions or issues with template validation, see the [Validation System
Documentation](../tools/VALIDATION_SYSTEM.md).
