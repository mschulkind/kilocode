# Testing Documentation

> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️

Welcome to the testing documentation! 🧪 This directory covers testing strategies, frameworks, and
best practices for ensuring KiloCode's quality and reliability.

## 🗺️ Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths
- **Something's Broken**: Check [Testing Strategy](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for troubleshooting
- **Need to Understand**: Start with [Repository Overview](README.md) for an overview
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow testing setup and execution guides

### Current Focus
- Unit testing strategies and frameworks
- Integration testing approaches
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Test coverage and quality metrics

## 📚 Documentation Structure
- **[Repository Overview](README.md)** - Master index of all testing documentation
- **[Testing Strategy](TESTING_STRATEGY.md)** - Comprehensive testing strategy and approach

## 🔗 Cross-References
- **Architecture**: See [Architecture Documentation](../../architecture/) for testing architecture
- **Services**: See [Services Documentation](../../services/) for service testing
- **Standards**: See [Standards Documentation](../../standards////////) for testing standards

## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of testing like the fossil validation process in paleontology. Just as paleontologists use
multiple techniques (carbon dating, comparative anatomy, geological analysis) to verify the
authenticity and age of fossils, we use multiple testing approaches (unit tests, integration tests,
e2e tests) to verify the correctness and reliability of our code. Each test is like a different
validation technique, and together they give us confidence in our system!
