## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of testing like the fossil validation process in paleontology. Just as paleontologists use
multiple techniques (carbon dating, comparative anatomy, geological analysis) to verify the
authenticity and age of fossils, we use multiple testing approaches (unit tests, integration tests,
e2e tests) to verify the correctness and reliability of our code. Each test is like a different
validation technique, and together they give us confidence in our system!
