# Documentation Best Practices

## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: This document covers \[DOCUMENT PURPOSE BASED ON FILE PATH].
- **Context**: Use this as a starting point or reference while navigating the project.
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! üèóÔ∏è

This guide outlines the best practices for writing and maintaining high-quality documentation in the
KiloCode project.

## Writing Guidelines

### 1. Structure and Organization

- *Clear Hierarchy*\*

```markdown
# Main Title (H1) - Only one per document

> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! üèóÔ∏è

## Major Section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

#### Detail Section (H4)
```

- *Logical Flow*\*
- Start with overview and purpose
- Progress from general to specific
- End with next steps or related resources
- Use consistent section ordering

- *File Organization*\*

```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/          # System design docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/             # Service-specific docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/                # Tool and process docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ standards/            # Coding and style standards
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ improvements/         # Improvement proposals
```

### 2. Content Quality

- *Research Context*\* Every document should include:

```markdown
## Research Context

Brief description of the research, background, and context that led to this document. Explain the
"why" behind the content.
```

- *Engaging Content*\*
- Include fun facts where appropriate
- Use analogies and examples
- Make content accessible to different skill levels
- Include visual elements when helpful

- *No Dead Ends Policy*\*
- Every document should have clear next steps
- Link to related resources
- Provide navigation paths
- Avoid orphaned content

```markdown
## No Dead Ends Policy

This document follows the "No Dead Ends" principle - every path leads to useful information.

- Each section provides clear navigation to related content
- All internal links are validated and point to existing documents  
- Cross-references include context for better understanding
```

### 3. Writing Style

- *Tone and Voice*\*
- Professional but approachable
- Clear and concise
- Consistent terminology
- Active voice preferred

- *Technical Accuracy*\*
- Verify all technical claims
- Include code examples that work
- Update outdated information
- Cross-reference related concepts

- *Accessibility*\*
- Use descriptive headings
- Include alt text for images
- Provide text alternatives for diagrams
- Use clear, simple language

## Formatting Standards

### 1. Markdown Best Practices

- *Headings*\*

```markdown
# Use Title Case for H1

> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why" behind the "what"! üíª

## Use Sentence case for H2 and below

### Avoid too many heading levels
```

- *Lists*\*

```markdown
<!-- Use consistent bullet points -->
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

<!-- For ordered lists -->
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

- *Code Blocks*\*

````markdown
```javascript
// Use appropriate language tags
const example = "with syntax highlighting"
```
````

````

- *Links**
```markdown
<!-- Use descriptive link text -->
[KiloCode Documentation](../README.md)

<!-- Not just URLs -->
https://example.com ‚ùå
[Example Website](https://example.com) ‚úÖ
````

### 2. Required Sections

- *Document Length*\*
- Target: 300-1500 words per document
- Split large documents at natural boundaries
- Each document should cover one main concept

- *Table of Contents*\* (for files >500 words)

```markdown
## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Main Content](#main-content)
- [Examples](#examples)
- [Conclusion](#conclusion)
```

- *Navigation Footer*\*

```markdown
- *Navigation**: [‚Üê Back to Parent] ¬∑ [üìö Technical Glossary] ¬∑ [‚Üë Table of Contents]
```

- *Research Context*\*

```markdown
## Research Context

Brief description of the research, background, and context that led to this document. Explain the
"why" behind the content.
```

- *No Dead Ends Policy*\*

```markdown
## No Dead Ends Policy

This document follows the "No Dead Ends" principle - every path leads to useful information.

- Each section provides clear navigation to related content
- All internal links are validated and point to existing documents  
- Cross-references include context for better understanding
```

### 3. Visual Elements

- *Images*\*
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include alt text
- Optimize file sizes
- Use consistent formats (PNG, SVG)

- *Diagrams*\*
- Use Mermaid for flowcharts
- Include text descriptions
- Keep diagrams simple and clear
- Update when content changes

- *Code Examples*\*
- Use working code
- Include comments
- Show expected output
- Test all examples
