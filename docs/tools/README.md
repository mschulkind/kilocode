## When You're Here

This document is part of the KiloCode project documentation. If you're not familiar with this
document's role or purpose, this section helps orient you.

- **Purpose**: This document covers \[DOCUMENT PURPOSE BASED ON FILE PATH].
- **Context**: Use this as a starting point or reference while navigating the project.
- **Navigation**: Use the table of contents below to jump to specific topics.

> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems,
> this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! üîß

Welcome to the tools documentation! üõ†Ô∏è This directory covers the tool system architecture and how
KiloCode integrates with various development tools.

### Quick Start Paths

- **Something's Broken**: Check [TOOL\_SYSTEM\_ARCHITECTURE.md](TOOL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) for
  troubleshooting
- **Need to Understand**: Start with [Repository Overview](README.md) for an overview
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow tool integration and usage guides

### Current Focus
- Tool system architecture and design
- Tool execution and management
- Tool integration patterns
- Tool performance and optimization

## üìö Documentation Structure

- **[Repository Overview](README.md)** - Master index of all tool documentation
- **[TOOL\_SYSTEM\_ARCHITECTURE.md](TOOL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Comprehensive tool system
  architecture

- **Standards**: See [Parent directory](../standards/) for tool standards

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of tools like the specialized adaptations that different dinosaurs had for their specific
tasks. Just as a T-Rex had powerful jaws for hunting, a Triceratops had defensive horns, and a
Pterodactyl had wings for flying, our tools are specialized for different development tasks. Each
tool is like a different dinosaur species, perfectly adapted to its specific function in the
development ecosystem!

## Validation System

The validation system has been simplified for better performance and maintainability:

- **[Validation System Simplified](./VALIDATION_SYSTEM_SIMPLIFIED.md)** - Overview of the simplified validation system
- **[Migration Guide](./VALIDATION_SYSTEM_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** - Step-by-step migration instructions  
- **[Breaking Changes](./VALIDATION_SYSTEM_BREAKING_CHANGES.md)** - List of breaking changes and impact
- **[Finalization Report](./VALIDATION_SYSTEM_FINALIZATION.md)** - Complete project summary and results
