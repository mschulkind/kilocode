## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of tools like the specialized adaptations that different dinosaurs had for their specific
tasks. Just as a T-Rex had powerful jaws for hunting, a Triceratops had defensive horns, and a
Pterodactyl had wings for flying, our tools are specialized for different development tasks. Each
tool is like a different dinosaur species, perfectly adapted to its specific function in the
development ecosystem!
