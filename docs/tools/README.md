# Tools Documentation

> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧

Welcome to the tools documentation! 🛠️ This directory covers the tool system architecture and how
KiloCode integrates with various development tools.

## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of tools like the specialized adaptations that different dinosaurs had for their specific
tasks. Just as a T-Rex had powerful jaws for hunting, a Triceratops had defensive horns, and a
Pterodactyl had wings for flying, our tools are specialized for different development tasks. Each
tool is like a different dinosaur species, perfectly adapted to its specific function in the
development ecosystem!
