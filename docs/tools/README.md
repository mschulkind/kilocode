Welcome to the tools documentation! üõ†Ô∏è This directory covers the tool system architecture and how
KiloCode integrates with various development tools.

### Quick Start Paths

- **Something's Broken**: Check [TOOL\_SYSTEM\_ARCHITECTURE.md](TOOL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) for
  troubleshooting
- **Need to Understand**: Start with [Repository Overview](README.md) for an overview
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow tool integration and usage guides

### Current Focus
- Tool system architecture and design
- Tool execution and management
- Tool integration patterns
- Tool performance and optimization

## üìö Documentation Structure

- **[Repository Overview](README.md)** - Master index of all tool documentation
- **[TOOL\_SYSTEM\_ARCHITECTURE.md](TOOL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Comprehensive tool system
  architecture

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of tools like the specialized adaptations that different dinosaurs had for their specific
tasks. Just as a T-Rex had powerful jaws for hunting, a Triceratops had defensive horns, and a
Pterodactyl had wings for flying, our tools are specialized for different development tasks. Each
tool is like a different dinosaur species, perfectly adapted to its specific function in the
development ecosystem!
