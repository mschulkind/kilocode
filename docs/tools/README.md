# Tools Documentation

> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! üîß

Welcome to the tools documentation! üõ†Ô∏è This directory covers the tool system architecture and how
KiloCode integrates with various development tools.

## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Guide

### Quick Start Paths
- **Something's Broken**: Check [Tool System Architecture](TOOL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) for
  troubleshooting
- **Need to Understand**: Start with [Repository Overview](README.md) for an overview
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow tool integration and usage guides

### Current Focus
- Tool system architecture and design
- Tool execution and management
- Tool integration patterns
- Tool performance and optimization

## üìö Documentation Structure
- **[Repository Overview](README.md)** - Master index of all tool documentation
- **[Tool System Architecture](TOOL_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Comprehensive tool system
  architecture

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of tools like the specialized adaptations that different dinosaurs had for their specific
tasks. Just as a T-Rex had powerful jaws for hunting, a Triceratops had defensive horns, and a
Pterodactyl had wings for flying, our tools are specialized for different development tasks. Each
tool is like a different dinosaur species, perfectly adapted to its specific function in the
development ecosystem!
