## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of the UI like the external appearance and behavior of a dinosaur. Just as a dinosaur's skin,
scales, and movements were the interface between its internal systems and the external world, our UI
is the interface between our internal systems and the user. The chat interface is like the
dinosaur's mouth - the primary way it communicates with the world. The task windows are like the
dinosaur's eyes - focused views of specific information!
