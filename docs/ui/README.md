# UI Documentation

> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️

Welcome to the UI documentation! 🎨 This directory covers the user interface layer, chat systems,
and task window management in KiloCode.

### Quick Start Paths
- **Something's Broken**: Check [UI Layer System](UI_LAYER_SYSTEM.md) for troubleshooting
- **Need to Understand**: Start with [Repository Overview](README.md) for an overview
- **Implementation Journey**: Follow UI architecture and component guides

### Current Focus
- Chat interface and message flow
- Task window management
- UI component architecture
- User experience optimization

## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy

Think of the UI like the external appearance and behavior of a dinosaur. Just as a dinosaur's skin,
scales, and movements were the interface between its internal systems and the external world, our UI
is the interface between our internal systems and the user. The chat interface is like the
dinosaur's mouth - the primary way it communicates with the world. The task windows are like the
dinosaur's eyes - focused views of specific information!
