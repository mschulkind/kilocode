# UI Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the user interface layer of KiloCode, covering chat systems, task window management, and UI component architecture.

## Documentation Structure

The UI documentation is organized into focused, specialized documents:

- **[UI Layer System](UI_LAYER_SYSTEM.md)** - Complete architecture and design patterns for the UI layer
- **[Chat Task Window](UI_CHAT_TASK_WINDOW.md)** - Chat interface and task window component implementation
- **[Message Flow System](UI_MESSAGE_FLOW_SYSTEM.md)** - Message routing, state management, and communication patterns

## Quick Navigation

### For Developers
- **Understanding UI Architecture**: Start with [UI Layer System](UI_LAYER_SYSTEM.md)
- **Implementing Chat Features**: Reference [Chat Task Window](UI_CHAT_TASK_WINDOW.md)
- **Managing Message Flow**: See [Message Flow System](UI_MESSAGE_FLOW_SYSTEM.md)

### For Troubleshooting
- **UI Component Issues**: Check [UI Layer System](UI_LAYER_SYSTEM.md) for component patterns
- **Chat Interface Problems**: Review [Chat Task Window](UI_CHAT_TASK_WINDOW.md) for implementation details
- **Message Routing Issues**: Consult [Message Flow System](UI_MESSAGE_FLOW_SYSTEM.md) for flow patterns

## System Integration

The UI layer integrates with several other system components:

- **Architecture Layer**: See [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/README.md) for system-wide patterns
- **Service Layer**: Review [Service Documentation](../services/README.md) for UI-related services
- **Standards**: Follow [Documentation Standards](../standards/README.md) for UI development guidelines

## Key Concepts

### User Interface Design
The UI serves as the primary interface between users and the KiloCode system, providing intuitive access to chat functionality and task management.

### Component Architecture
UI components are built using a modular architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability.

### Message Flow
The system implements sophisticated message routing and state management to ensure reliable communication between UI components.
