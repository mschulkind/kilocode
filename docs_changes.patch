 ## Timestamp generation & normalization
 
-- **Source-of-Truth Clock:** The orchestrator is the source of truth for the canonical `timestamp`. While the UI records an `uiEnqueue` time, the orchestrator's clock is considered authoritative for sequencing messages to mitigate client-side clock skew. The primary `timestamp` should be generated by the orchestrator upon receiving the message.
-- **Ordering Guarantees:** Messages will be primarily sorted by their `timestamp`. In the rare event of a tie, a secondary sort key (e.g., monotonic sequence ID from the orchestrator) will be used to ensure stable ordering.
-- **Late-Arriving Updates:** For streaming messages, the `lifecycleTimestamps` object may be updated after the initial message is rendered (e.g., `providerCompleted` arrives last). The UI should be capable of handling these late updates without causing a re-render of the primary message timestamp.
-- **Clock Skew Mitigation:** During event instrumentation, the system will compare the `uiEnqueue` timestamp (from the client) with the `orchestratorDispatch` timestamp (from the server). If the delta exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 5 seconds), a warning will be logged, and the `clockSkewDetected: true` flag will be attached to the message metadata.

 ## Event timeline instrumentation
 
 The four primary lifecycle events are defined as follows:
 
-1.  **UI Enqueue:** The moment the user initiates a "send" action in the UI.
-2.  **Orchestrator Dispatch:** The moment the orchestrator validates the request and dispatches it to a provider.
-3.  **Provider First Token:** The moment the first chunk of a streaming response is received from the provider.
-4.  **Provider Finalization:** The moment the provider signals the end of the response stream.

 ## Persistence & rehydration

-- **Backward Compatibility:** For legacy messages loaded from history that lack a timestamp, the system will set the `timestamp` to the time of rehydration and attach the `timestampInferred: true` flag.

+# Documentation Automation Setup Guide
+
+> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️
+
+This guide explains how to set up and use the automated documentation validation and maintenance
+system for KiloCode.
+
+## Overview
+
+The documentation automation system uses Remark to validate markdown files and ensure they meet
+KiloCode's documentation standards. It includes:
+
+- Automated validation of markdown files
+- Proactive maintenance tools
+- Custom KiloCode-specific validation rules
+- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
+- IDE integration for real-time validation
+
+## Installation
+
+The documentation automation dependencies are already installed in the workspace. They include:
+
+- `remark-cli` - Command-line interface for remark
+- `remark-preset-lint-recommended` - Recommended linting rules
+- `remark-validate-links` - Link validation
+- `remark-toc` - Table of contents generation
+- `remark-gfm` - GitHub Flavored Markdown support
+- `remark-stringify` - Markdown stringification
+- `remark-frontmatter` - Frontmatter support
+
+## Configuration
+
+The system is configured via `.remarkrc` in the project root:
+
+```json
+{
+	"plugins": [
+		"remark-preset-lint-recommended",
+		"remark-gfm",
+		"remark-frontmatter",
+		"remark-toc",
+		"remark-validate-links"
+	],
+	"settings": {
+		"bullet": "-",
+		"emphasis": "*",
+		"fence": "`",
+		"listItemIndent": "one",
+		"rule": "-",
+		"ruleRepetition": 3,
+		"ruleSpaces": false,
+		"strong": "*"
+	},
+	"validateLinks": {
+		"repository": "roo-ai/kilo-code",
+		"branches": ["main", "master"],
+		"ignore": ["https://github.com/roo-ai/kilo-code/issues/*", "https://github.com/roo-ai/kilo-code/discussions/*"]
+	}
+}
+```
+
+## Usage
+
+### Available Scripts
+
+- `pnpm docs:validate` - Validate all documentation files (quiet mode)
+- `pnpm docs:validate:verbose` - Validate all documentation files with detailed output
+- `pnpm docs:fix` - Auto-fix common documentation issues
+- `pnpm docs:maintain` - Run proactive maintenance tools
+- `pnpm docs:report` - Generate detailed validation reports
+- `pnpm docs:metrics` - Generate documentation metrics
+
+### Basic Validation
+
+To validate all documentation files:
+
+```bash
+pnpm docs:validate
+```
+
+To validate specific files:
+
+```bash
+remark path/to/file.md
+```
+
+### Auto-fixing Issues
+
+Many common issues can be automatically fixed:
+
+```bash
+pnpm docs:fix
+```
+
+## Integration
+
+### Pre-commit Hooks
+
+Documentation validation is integrated into pre-commit hooks to ensure all documentation meets
+standards before commits.
+
+### CI/CD Pipeline
+
+The system includes GitHub Actions workflows that validate documentation on pull requests and
+pushes.
+
+#### GitHub Actions Workflow
+
+The documentation validation workflow (`.github/workflows/docs-validation.yml`) runs on:
+
+- **Push events** to main/master branches when markdown files are changed
+- **Pull request events** to main/master branches when markdown files are changed
+
+The workflow includes two jobs:
+
+1. **Documentation Validation**: Validates all documentation files using remark
+2. **Documentation Maintenance**: Auto-fixes common issues and commits changes back to PRs
+
+#### Workflow Features
+
+- Validates documentation on every PR and push
+- Generates detailed validation reports on failure
+- Auto-maintains documentation by fixing common issues
+- Uploads validation reports as artifacts for debugging
+- Skips CI on auto-maintenance commits to prevent loops
+
+### IDE Integration
+
+VS Code integration provides real-time validation as you edit markdown files.
+
+## Troubleshooting
+
+### Common Issues
+
+1. **Link validation errors**: Ensure all internal links use relative paths and external links are
+   valid
+2. **Literal URL warnings**: Wrap bare URLs in angle brackets `<url>`
+3. **Heading hierarchy issues**: Ensure proper heading levels (no skipping levels)
+
+### Getting Help
+
+For issues with the documentation automation system:
+
+1. Check the validation output for specific error messages
+2. Review the documentation standards in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
+3. Use `pnpm docs:validate:verbose` for detailed error information
+
+## Next Steps
+
+After setup, the system will:
+
+1. Validate all documentation on every commit
+2. Provide real-time feedback in your IDE
+3. Generate reports on documentation quality
+4. Help maintain consistent documentation standards
+
+For advanced configuration and custom rules, see the Phase 1 implementation plan in
+`context/doc_automation/phase1.md`.

+# Pre-commit Hooks Documentation
+
+> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧
+
+## Overview
+
+This project uses Husky to manage Git pre-commit hooks that automatically validate and maintain
+documentation before commits are accepted.
+
+## Configuration
+
+### Husky Setup
+
+The project uses Husky v9.1.7 for Git hook management. The pre-commit hook is located at
+`.husky/pre-commit` and includes:
+
+1. **Branch Protection**: Prevents direct commits to main branch (unless tracking origin/main)
+2. **Lint-staged**: Runs linting on staged files
+3. **General Linting**: Runs project-wide linting
+4. **Documentation Validation**: Validates all markdown files using remark
+5. **Documentation Maintenance**: Automatically maintains documentation structure
+
+### Pre-commit Hook Flow
+
+```bash
+# 1. Check branch protection
+
+> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧
+# 2. Run lint-staged on staged files
+
+> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧
+# 3. Run general project linting
+
+> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why" behind the "what"! 💻
+# 4. Validate documentation with remark
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+# 5. Run documentation maintenance
+
+> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️
+
+```
+
+## Documentation Validation
+
+The pre-commit hook runs the following documentation checks:
+
+### Validation Commands
+
+- `pnpm docs:validate` - Validates all markdown files using remark with custom KiloCode plugins
+- `pnpm docs:maintain` - Automatically maintains documentation structure (TOC, navigation, etc.)
+
+### Validation Rules
+
+The documentation validation enforces:
+
+- **KiloCode Standards**: Custom validation rules specific to KiloCode documentation
+- **Markdown Standards**: Standard markdown linting rules
+- **Link Validation**: Internal and external link validation
+- **Structure Validation**: Required sections and proper hierarchy
+- **Content Quality**: Readability and consistency checks
+
+### Auto-fix Capabilities
+
+Some documentation issues can be automatically fixed:
+
+- Table of Contents generation
+- Navigation footer updates
+- Research context sections
+- Basic formatting issues
+
+Run `pnpm docs:fix` to automatically fix fixable issues.
+
+## Error Handling
+
+### Validation Failures
+
+If documentation validation fails:
+
+1. **Commit is blocked** - The commit will not proceed
+2. **Error details shown** - Specific validation errors are displayed
+3. **Fix suggestions provided** - Guidance on how to resolve issues
+4. **Auto-fix recommendation** - Suggests running `pnpm docs:fix`
+
+### Common Issues and Solutions
+
+#### Link Validation Errors
+
+```bash
+# Fix: Update broken links or use descriptive link text
+
+> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧
+
+[Descriptive Text](https://example.com)  # Good
+https://example.com                       # Bad - use descriptive text
+```
+
+#### Missing Required Sections
+
+```bash
+# Fix: Add required sections like Research Context
+
+> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧
+## Research Context
+
+<!-- Add research context here -->
+```
+
+#### Heading Hierarchy Issues
+
+```bash
+# Fix: Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3)
+
+> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧
+# Title
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+## Section
+### Subsection
+
+```
+
+## Bypassing Hooks (Emergency Only)
+
+⚠️ **Warning**: Only bypass hooks in emergency situations and fix issues immediately after.
+
+### Skip Pre-commit Hook
+
+```bash
+git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency commit message"
+```
+
+### Skip All Hooks
+
+```bash
+git commit --no-verify --no-edit
+```
+
+## Troubleshooting
+
+### Hook Not Running
+
+1. **Check permissions**: Ensure `.husky/pre-commit` is executable
+
+    ```bash
+    chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
+    ```
+
+2. **Verify Husky installation**: Run `pnpm prepare` to reinstall hooks
+
+3. **Check Git configuration**: Ensure hooks directory is correct
+    ```bash
+    git config core.hooksPath
+    ```
+
+### Performance Issues
+
+If validation is slow:
+
+1. **Run validation on specific files**:
+
+    ```bash
+    pnpm docs:validate path/to/file.md
+    ```
+
+2. **Use quiet mode**:
+
+    ```bash
+    pnpm docs:validate --quiet
+    ```
+
+3. **Skip maintenance temporarily**:
+    ```bash
+    # Edit .husky/pre-commit to comment out docs:maintain
+    ```
+
+### Validation Errors
+
+#### Too Many Warnings
+
+- Focus on errors first, warnings can be addressed later
+- Use `--quiet` flag to reduce output
+- Consider updating validation rules if warnings are not actionable
+
+#### False Positives
+
+- Report false positives to the team
+- Consider updating validation rules
+- Use inline comments to suppress specific warnings
+
+## Best Practices
+
+### Before Committing
+
+1. **Run validation manually**:
+
+    ```bash
+    pnpm docs:validate
+    pnpm docs:maintain
+    ```
+
+2. **Fix issues early**:
+
+    ```bash
+    pnpm docs:fix
+    ```
+
+3. **Review changes**:
+    ```bash
+    git diff
+    ```
+
+### Commit Messages
+
+Use descriptive commit messages that include:
+
+- Type of change (docs, fix, feat, etc.)
+- Brief description
+- Reference to documentation standards if applicable
+
+Example:
+
+```bash
+git commit -m "docs: add pre-commit hooks documentation
+
+- Document pre-commit hook configuration
+- Add troubleshooting guide
+- Include best practices for documentation validation
+
+Implements: T009 · Phase 1 Task 3.1: Implement Pre-commit Hooks"
+```
+
+## Integration with CI/CD
+
+The pre-commit hooks complement the CI/CD pipeline:
+
+- **Pre-commit**: Fast local validation and auto-fixes
+- **CI/CD**: Comprehensive validation and reporting
+- **Both**: Ensure documentation quality and consistency
+
+## Maintenance
+
+### Updating Hook Configuration
+
+1. **Edit `.husky/pre-commit`**
+2. **Test changes**:
+    ```bash
+    ./.husky/pre-commit
+    ```
+3. **Commit changes**
+4. **Update documentation**
+
+### Adding New Validation Rules
+
+1. **Update validation plugins**
+2. **Test with sample files**
+3. **Update documentation**
+4. **Notify team of changes**
+
+## Support
+
+For issues with pre-commit hooks:
+
+1. **Check this documentation**
+2. **Review error messages carefully**
+3. **Try suggested fixes**
+4. **Ask team for help if needed**
+5. **Report bugs or false positives**

 ## Executive Summary
 
-The API duplication issue is caused by a **race condition** introduced in commit `749f3d22a` where both the main task loop and subtask completion can simultaneously call `recursivelyMakeClineRequests`, each making their own API request. This results in multiple simultaneous API calls with spinners appearing in the chat interface, causing jumbled responses and confused user experience.

+simultaneous API calls with spinners appearing in the chat interface, causing jumbled responses and

 **Key Findings:**
 
-- **Root Cause**: Concurrent calls to `recursivelyMakeClineRequests` from two different execution paths
+- **Root Cause**: Concurrent calls to `recursivelyMakeClineRequests` from two different execution

 - **Trigger**: Recent change to subtask completion handling in `ClineProvider.ts`
 - **Impact**: Multiple API requests, jumbled responses, confused chat interface
 - **Solution**: Synchronization mechanism to ensure only one recursive call executes at a time

 ## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy
 
-Think of race conditions like two dinosaurs trying to eat from the same carcass at the same time. Just as they might bump into each other and cause chaos, our concurrent API calls bump into each other and cause jumbled responses. The solution is like having a feeding hierarchy - only one dinosaur eats at a time, but they take turns in an organized way!

-For high-risk files like `package.json`, consider maintaining a separate integration branch where dependency conflicts are resolved before merging into your main development branch. This allows you to test dependency changes in isolation and ensures that your main development work isn't blocked by dependency conflicts.

 ### Conflict Resolution Strategies
 
 **The Three-Way Merge Approach**
 
-Most merge conflicts can be resolved using a three-way merge strategy, where you consider the common ancestor, the upstream version, and your local version. Understanding the intent behind each change is more important than mechanically applying merge resolution rules.

 **Semantic vs. Syntactic Conflicts**
 
-Not all conflicts are created equal. Syntactic conflicts (like formatting differences) are usually easy to resolve automatically. Semantic conflicts (where the same functionality is implemented differently) require human judgment and understanding of the broader system architecture.

 **Documentation-First Resolution**
 
-When conflicts arise, document your resolution decisions clearly. This helps future developers understand why certain choices were made and provides context for future similar conflicts. This documentation is especially valuable for dependency conflicts, where the reasoning behind version choices isn't always obvious.

 ### The Importance of Change Tracking
 
-Maintaining clear documentation of where code comes from and how it's been modified is crucial for long-term project maintainability. Without proper tracking, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the origins of features, debug issues, and make informed decisions about future changes.

 ## Race Condition Details
 
 **The Specific Race Condition Created:**
 
-- **Problem**: Concurrent calls to `recursivelyMakeClineRequests` from both the main orchestrator loop and the new `continueParentTask` method
-- **Trigger**: When a subtask completes while the parent orchestrator is still actively running (no navigation occurred)
-- **Symptoms**: Multiple simultaneous API requests with spinners, jumbled responses, XML corruption in chat history
-- **Severity**: 2-request race condition (common) and 3-request race condition (severe, causes cascading failures)

+
 **Purpose:** Executive summary and problem description for the API duplication race condition issue.
 
 ## Executive Summary
 
-The API duplication issue is caused by a **race condition** introduced in commit `749f3d22a` where both the main task loop and subtask completion can simultaneously call `recursivelyMakeClineRequests`, each making their own API request. This results in multiple simultaneous API calls with spinners appearing in the chat interface, causing jumbled responses and confused user experience.

+## Documentation Automation
+
+### Overview
+
+KiloCode uses automated documentation validation and maintenance to ensure consistent, high-quality
+documentation across the project.
+
+### Validation Process
+
+**Automatic Validation**:
+
+- Real-time validation in VS Code
+- Pre-commit validation hooks
+- CI/CD pipeline validation
+- Comprehensive error reporting
+
+**Manual Validation**:
+
+```bash
+# Validate all documentation
+
+> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧
+
+pnpm docs:validate
+
+# Validate specific directory
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+
+pnpm docs:validate docs/
+
+# Validate specific file
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+
+npx remark docs/file.md
+```
+
+### Maintenance Process
+
+**Automated Maintenance**:
+
+- Table of Contents generation
+- Navigation footer updates
+- Research context validation
+- Link health checking
+
+**Manual Maintenance**:
+
+```bash
+# Run automated maintenance
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+
+pnpm docs:maintain
+
+# Generate validation report
+
+> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️
+
+pnpm docs:report
+```
+
+### Documentation Standards
+
+**Required Sections**:
+
+- Research Context section
+- Navigation footer
+- Table of Contents (for files >500 words)
+- Descriptive link text
+
+**Style Requirements**:
+
+- Consistent formatting
+- Proper heading hierarchy
+- Alt text for images
+- Working code examples
+
+### VS Code Integration
+
+**Extensions** (auto-installed):
+
+- Markdown All in One
+- markdownlint
+- MDX support
+
+**Features**:
+
+- Real-time validation
+- Auto-fix on save
+- Live link validation
+- TOC auto-generation
+
+### Troubleshooting
+
+**Common Issues**:
+
+- Validation not running → Check extensions, run `pnpm install`
+- Auto-fix not working → Check VS Code settings, restart
+- Performance issues → Exclude large dirs, use incremental validation
+
+**Resources**:
+
+- [Remark Workflow Overview](../../tools/REMARK_WORKFLOW_OVERVIEW.md)
+- [Validation Errors Guide](../../tools/VALIDATION_ERRORS_GUIDE.md)
+- [Troubleshooting Guide](../../tools/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md)
+- [Documentation Best Practices](../../tools/DOCUMENTATION_BEST_PRACTICES.md)

 ## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy
 
-Think of the repository like a dinosaur fossil site - it contains many different layers and components that tell the story of how the system evolved. Just as paleontologists carefully catalog and organize fossils by type, age, and location, we organize our code by function, purpose, and architectural layer. Each directory is like a different excavation site, revealing different aspects of the system's structure!

-Think of technical debt like sediment layers in a fossil bed - each layer represents a different era of development decisions. Some layers are well-preserved (good architecture), while others show signs of erosion (technical debt). Our job is to carefully excavate and preserve the good while cleaning up the problematic layers!

 #### Task Engine
 
-The `Task` engine is the central coordinator. It maintains the state of the current operation, manages the conversation history with the model, and orchestrates calls to other components. The [`recursivelyMakeClineRequests`](/src/core/task/Task.ts#L1735) function is the primary driver of the iterative execution loop.

+the iterative execution loop.
 
 #### Streaming Parser
 
-The parser's role is critical for performance and responsiveness. It scans the model's output stream for XML-like tool-call syntax. This allows the system to act on a tool request before the full model response has been received, enabling parallel execution of long-running tasks.

+response has been received, enabling parallel execution of long-running tasks.
 
 #### Tool Executor & Library
 
-The executor acts as a gateway to the `ToolLibrary`. Before invoking a tool, it consults the **Mode & Permission Service**. If a tool is not permitted in the current mode, it throws a [`FileRestrictionError`](/src/shared/modes.ts#L157) or a similar permissions-related error, which is then handled by the Task Engine.

 Key principles:
 
-- **Informative Feedback**: Errors are not just caught; they are formatted into a clear, descriptive message that is fed back into the task's execution loop.
-- **Model-Led Recovery**: The language model is responsible for attempting to correct its own mistakes. If it tries to use a tool with incorrect parameters, the resulting error message should guide it to fix the call in its next attempt.
-- **Finite Retries**: To prevent infinite loops of failure, the system employs a "Mistake Limit" to halt tasks that are repeatedly failing.

 ## High-Level Responsibilities
 
-The Orchestrator is responsible for managing the end-to-end lifecycle of a user's task. This includes interpreting the request, executing tools, managing state, and ensuring safe, predictable outcomes.
-
-- **System Prompt Assembly:** Constructs the master prompt that guides the model by combining user requests, system instructions, and context. See [`getSystemPrompt`](/src/core/task/Task.ts#L2499).

 ## Core Concepts At a Glance
 
-- **Mode:** A distinct persona or capability set (e.g., `code`, `architect`) that defines available tools and operational boundaries.
-- **Tool Invocation:** The process by which the model requests to execute a system-provided function (e.g., `read_file`, `apply_diff`).
-- **Subtask:** A discrete unit of work delegated by the Orchestrator to a specialized mode or function, managed via [`startSubtask`](/\src/core/task/Task.ts#L1628) and [`completeSubtask`](/\src/core/task/Task.ts#L1669).
-- **Todo Gating:** A mechanism that requires the model to create and follow a plan (`todo list`) for complex tasks, ensuring structured execution.
-- **Streaming Parser:** The component responsible for real-time parsing of the model's output stream to identify and execute tool calls as they arrive.
-- **Mistake Limit:** A configurable threshold for the number of consecutive errors a model can make before the task is halted.
-- **Continuity Metadata:** Information passed between tasks to maintain context, such as the last active file or user selections.
-- **File Restriction:** A security mechanism that limits file system access based on the active mode's permissions, enforced via [`FileRestrictionError`](/\src/shared/modes.ts#L157).

 #### Stage 1: Initiation
 
-A task begins when an external caller (e.g., the VS Code extension UI) invokes the [`initiateTaskLoop`](/src/core/task/Task.ts#L1699) function. At this stage, the `Task` object is created, initial state is set up, and the context for the task is established.

-The `Task` engine constructs the initial prompt to be sent to the language model.

 #### Stage 4: Parsing & Execution Loop
 
-This is the core interactive phase of the lifecycle, driven by [`recursivelyMakeClineRequests`](/src/core/task/Task.ts#L1735). When the parser identifies a valid tool call, the `ToolExecutor` validates and runs it. The result of the tool execution is then appended to the conversation history, and the loop continues by sending the updated context back to the model.

 This approach has several advantages:
 
-- **Isolation**: Subtasks have their own context and history, preventing prompt contamination and allowing the model to focus on a specific goal.
-- **Specialization**: A subtask can be initiated in a different `Mode` than its parent, granting it access to a specialized set of tools. For example, a `code` mode task could delegate to a `test` mode subtask.
-- **Resilience**: An error in a subtask does not automatically fail the parent task. The parent can decide how to proceed based on the subtask's result.
-- **Clarity**: It creates a clear, hierarchical structure for complex work, which is easier to debug and manage.

+layers that power KiloCode's functionality.
 
 ## Directory Context
 
-The services directory contains comprehensive documentation for understanding KiloCode's service layer architecture and patterns. This includes core services (cloud, authentication, AI interaction), AI & ML services (prompt systems, code indexing), integration services (external APIs, data flows), and specialized services (monitoring, observability). Essential for understanding how individual services operate within the larger system architecture.

-Think of services like the different organ systems in a dinosaur's body. Each service is like a specialized organ - the code index service is like the brain (memory and retrieval), the cloud services are like the circulatory system (transporting data), and the marketplace is like the digestive system (processing and distributing resources). Just as dinosaurs needed all their organ systems working together to survive, our system needs all services working in harmony!

+different habitats), our glossary helps you distinguish between different types of technical
+concepts (data structures vs. functions, different architectural layers, different execution
+contexts)!

-_Consistent heading hierarchy is essential for document organization, navigation, and accessibility. These standards ensure that all KiloCode documentation follows a predictable structure that helps both authors and readers navigate content effectively._
+## Research Context
+
+**Purpose:** Establish comprehensive standards for heading hierarchy and structure across all
+KiloCode documentation to ensure consistent navigation and accessibility.
+
+**Background:** Inconsistent heading structures across documentation files were creating navigation
+challenges and accessibility issues. This document provides clear guidelines for maintaining proper
+heading hierarchy.
+
+**Research Questions:** How should headings be structured for optimal navigation? What case
+conventions should be used? When is H4 appropriate?
+
+**Methodology:** Analysis of existing documentation patterns, accessibility best practices, and
+markdown standards to create comprehensive guidelines.
+
+**Findings:** Clear hierarchy rules (H1→H2→H3 only, with H4 for tight enumerations), consistent case
+standards (Title case for H1, sentence case for H2/H3), and single H1 rule provide the best
+structure.

 ## Executive Summary
 
-_Table of contents elements provide essential navigation for readers, helping them understand document structure and quickly locate specific information. These standards ensure consistent TOC formatting and content across all KiloCode documentation._
+## Research Context
+
+**Purpose:** Define standards for table of contents (TOC) creation and formatting to improve
+document navigation and discoverability across all KiloCode documentation.
+
+**Background:** Inconsistent TOC formatting and missing TOCs in longer documents were making it
+difficult for users to navigate and find information efficiently.
+
+**Research Questions:** What format should TOCs use? When are TOCs required? What content should be
+included?
+
+**Methodology:** Analysis of documentation length patterns, user navigation needs, and markdown best
+practices to determine optimal TOC standards.
+
+**Findings:** Collapsible format with H2/H3 entries only, required for documents with 3+ H2s and
+800+ words, provides optimal navigation without cluttering shorter documents.

+2. Add started timestamp (ISO 8601)
+3. Update summary table
+4. Check off subtasks as completed
+5. Run tests/validation
+6. Add completed timestamp
+7. Update summary table
+8. Commit with task ID
+9. Update cross-references
+
+### Timestamp Format
+
+```
+2025-01-27T10:30:00Z
+```
+

+## Success Criteria Template
+
+```markdown
+## Success Criteria Checklist
+
+**[Phase] Success Metrics:**
+
+- [ ] [Measurable criterion 1]
+- [ ] [Measurable criterion 2]
+- [ ] [Performance metric]
+- [ ] [Team adoption metric]
+
+**Documentation Updates:**
+
+- [ ] [Doc update 1]
+- [ ] [Doc update 2]
+```
+
+## File Organization
+
+### Directory Structure
+
+```
+context/
+├── <proj_name>/
+│   ├── phase1.md
+│   ├── phase2.md
+│   └── phase3.md
+└── <other-project>/
+    └── phase1.md
+```
+
+### Naming Convention
+
+- **Project Name**: Extract from plan filename `<proj_name>_PLAN.md`
+- **Examples**:
+    - `API_GATEWAY_PLAN.md` → `context/api-gateway/`
+    - `USER_DASHBOARD_PLAN.md` → `context/user-dashboard/`
+    - `CI_CD_PIPELINE_PLAN.md` → `context/ci-cd-pipeline/`
+
+## Best Practices
+
+### Task Design
+
+- Break into specific, actionable subtasks
+- Include testing/validation steps
+- Add clear deliverables
+- Estimate time realistically
+
+### Progress Updates
+
+- Update checkboxes in real-time
+- Keep summary table current
+- Record actual time spent
+- Document lessons learned
+
+### Quality Assurance
+
+- Test each task completion
+- Validate configurations
+- Update documentation
+- Review with team
+
+## Common Mistakes to Avoid
+
+❌ **Too vague:** "Implement feature" ✅ **Specific:** "Create user authentication endpoint with JWT
+validation"
+
+❌ **No testing:** Missing validation steps ✅ **Testable:** Include unit tests, integration tests,
+manual testing
+
+❌ **No deliverables:** Unclear outputs ✅ **Clear outputs:** Specify files, configurations,
+documentation created
+
+❌ **Unrealistic estimates:** 1 hour for complex task ✅ **Realistic:** Break complex tasks into
+smaller pieces
+
+## Quick Commands
+
+### Create New Checklist
+
+```bash
+# Extract project name from plan filename
+
+> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️
+# If plan is API_GATEWAY_PLAN.md, project name is api-gateway
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+
+cp docs/tools/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md context/[proj_name]/phase1.md
+
+# Edit with your project details
+
+> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️
+
+code context/[proj_name]/phase1.md
+```
+
+### Update Progress
+
+1. Change status: `⏳ Pending` → `🔄 In Progress`
+2. Add timestamp: `2025-01-27T10:30:00Z`
+3. Check off subtasks: `[ ]` → `[x]`
+4. Update summary table
+
+### Complete Task
+
+1. Change status: `🔄 In Progress` → `✅ Done`
+2. Add completion timestamp
+3. Update summary table
+4. Commit with task ID

+# Documentation Best Practices
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+
+This guide outlines the best practices for writing and maintaining high-quality documentation in the
+KiloCode project.
+
+## Writing Guidelines
+
+### 1. Structure and Organization
+
+**Clear Hierarchy**
+
+```markdown
+# Main Title (H1) - Only one per document
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+
+## Major Section (H2)
+
+### Subsection (H3)
+
+#### Detail Section (H4)
+```
+
+**Logical Flow**
+
+- Start with overview and purpose
+- Progress from general to specific
+- End with next steps or related resources
+- Use consistent section ordering
+
+**File Organization**
+
+```
+docs/
+├── architecture/          # System design docs
+├── services/             # Service-specific docs
+├── tools/                # Tool and process docs
+├── standards/            # Coding and style standards
+└── improvements/         # Improvement proposals
+```
+
+### 2. Content Quality
+
+**Research Context** Every document should include:
+
+```markdown
+## Research Context
+
+Brief description of the research, background, and context that led to this document. Explain the
+"why" behind the content.
+```
+
+**Engaging Content**
+
+- Include fun facts where appropriate
+- Use analogies and examples
+- Make content accessible to different skill levels
+- Include visual elements when helpful
+
+**No Dead Ends Policy**
+
+- Every document should have clear next steps
+- Link to related resources
+- Provide navigation paths
+- Avoid orphaned content
+
+### 3. Writing Style
+
+**Tone and Voice**
+
+- Professional but approachable
+- Clear and concise
+- Consistent terminology
+- Active voice preferred
+
+**Technical Accuracy**
+
+- Verify all technical claims
+- Include code examples that work
+- Update outdated information
+- Cross-reference related concepts
+
+**Accessibility**
+
+- Use descriptive headings
+- Include alt text for images
+- Provide text alternatives for diagrams
+- Use clear, simple language
+
+## Formatting Standards
+
+### 1. Markdown Best Practices
+
+**Headings**
+
+```markdown
+# Use Title Case for H1
+
+> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why" behind the "what"! 💻
+
+## Use Sentence case for H2 and below
+
+### Avoid too many heading levels
+```
+
+**Lists**
+
+```markdown
+<!-- Use consistent bullet points -->
+
+- Item 1
+- Item 2
+- Item 3
+
+<!-- For ordered lists -->
+
+1. First step
+2. Second step
+3. Third step
+```
+
+**Code Blocks**
+
+````markdown
+```javascript
+// Use appropriate language tags
+const example = "with syntax highlighting"
+```
+````
+
+````
+
+**Links**
+```markdown
+<!-- Use descriptive link text -->
+[KiloCode Documentation](../README.md)
+
+<!-- Not just URLs -->
+https://example.com ❌
+[Example Website](https://example.com) ✅
+````
+
+### 2. Required Sections
+
+**Table of Contents** (for files >500 words)
+
+```markdown
+## Table of Contents
+
+- [Introduction](#introduction)
+- [Main Content](#main-content)
+- [Examples](#examples)
+- [Conclusion](#conclusion)
+```
+
+**Navigation Footer**
+
+```markdown
+**Navigation**: [← Back to Parent] · [📚 Technical Glossary] · [↑ Table of Contents]
+```
+
+**Research Context**
+
+```markdown
+## Research Context
+
+Brief description of the research and context behind this document.
+```
+
+### 3. Visual Elements
+
+**Images**
+
+- Use descriptive filenames
+- Include alt text
+- Optimize file sizes
+- Use consistent formats (PNG, SVG)
+
+**Diagrams**
+
+- Use Mermaid for flowcharts
+- Include text descriptions
+- Keep diagrams simple and clear
+- Update when content changes

+**Remaining:** 0h (Est.)
+```
+
+### Implementation Rules Template
+
+```markdown
+## Implementation Rules
+
+**Task ID convention:** Each task has a local unique ID `TNNN` (e.g., T001). IDs are unique within
+this plan only and may be reused in other plans.
+
+**For Each Task:**
+
+1. **Set status to In Progress** in this file
+2. **Add Started timestamp** in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2025-01-27T13:55:00Z)
+3. **Update the summary table** with started timestamp and In Progress status
+4. **Update subtask checkboxes in real-time** as individual subtasks are completed (not just when
+   the whole task is done)
+5. **Complete all subtasks** listed under the task
+6. **Run tests/validation** to verify correctness
+7. **Add Completed timestamp** in ISO 8601 format and set status to Done
+8. **Update the summary table** with actual completion time and final status
+9. **Commit and push** with the prescribed commit message format
+10. **Review and update** cross-links and references if impacted
+
+**Important Notes:**
+
+- **Subtask tracking**: Update individual subtask checkboxes `[ ]` → `[x]` as soon as each subtask
+  is completed
+- **Git tracking**: The `context/` directory is gitignored, so this task list file itself should NOT
+  be committed to git
+- **Progress visibility**: The summary table at the top provides an at-a-glance view of all task
+  statuses
+
+**Commit Message Format (must include Task ID):**
+```
+
+[type](TNNN): brief-description
+
+- specific change 1
+- specific change 2
+- specific change 3
+
+Implements: TNNN · Phase Task X.Y: Task Name
+
+```
+
+**Testing Requirements:**
+
+- Each task must be testable and verifiable
+- All code must run without errors
+- All configurations must be validated
+- All documentation must be updated
+```
+
+### Task Overview Template
+
+```markdown
+## Task Overview

+
+**Symptoms:**
+
+- No validation errors shown in VS Code
+- `pnpm docs:validate` command fails
+- No Problems panel entries
+
+**Diagnosis:**
+
+```bash
+# Check if remark is installed
+
+> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️
+
+npx remark --version
+
+# Check configuration
+
+> **Development Fun Fact**: Documentation is like code comments for humans - it explains the "why" behind the "what"! 💻
+
+cat .remarkrc
+
+# Test with single file
+
+> **System Fun Fact**: Every complex system is just a collection of simple parts working together - documentation helps us understand how! ⚙️
+
+npx remark docs/README.md
+```
+
+**Solutions:**

+    # Check .remarkrc exists and is valid
+    cat .remarkrc
+
+    # Test configuration
+    npx remark --config .remarkrc docs/
+    ```
+
+### 2. Auto-fix Not Working
+
+**Symptoms:**
+
+- Auto-fix on save doesn't work
+- Manual fix commands fail
+- Validation errors persist
+
+**Diagnosis:**
+
+```bash
+# Check VS Code settings
+

+
+grep -A 5 "codeActionsOnSave" .vscode/settings.json
+
+# Test manual fix
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+
+npx remark --use remark-stringify docs/
+```
+
+**Solutions:**
+
+1. **Enable Auto-fix**
+
+    ```json
+    {
+    	"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {

+    npx remark --use remark-stringify docs/file.md
+
+    # Fix all files
+    npx remark --use remark-stringify docs/
+    ```
+
+### 3. Performance Issues
+
+**Symptoms:**
+
+- Slow validation
+- VS Code becomes unresponsive
+- Long processing times
+
+**Diagnosis:**
+
+```bash
+# Check file counts
+
+> **Engineering Fun Fact**: Just as engineers use systematic approaches to solve complex problems, this documentation provides structured guidance for understanding and implementing solutions! 🔧
+
+find docs/ -name "*.md" | wc -l
+
+# Check file sizes
+
+> **Architecture Fun Fact**: Like a well-designed building, good documentation has a solid foundation, clear structure, and intuitive navigation! 🏗️
+
+find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec wc -c {} + | sort -n
+```
+
+**Solutions:**

+    <!-- Use relative paths -->
+
+    [Link Text](./relative/path/file.md)
+
+    <!-- Check file exists -->
+
+    ls -la docs/relative/path/file.md
+    ```
+
+2. **External Links**
+
+    ```markdown
+    <!-- Use descriptive text -->
+
+    [Example Website](https://example.com)
+
+    <!-- Check if site is accessible -->
+
+    curl -I https://example.com
+    ```
+
+3. **Configure Link Validation**
+    ```json
+    {
+    	"remark-validate-links": {
+    		"skipExternalLinks": true,
+    		"skipInternalLinks": false
+    	}
+    }
+    ```
+
+### 5. Extension Conflicts
+
+**Symptoms:**

 ## 🦕 Dinosaur Analogy
 
-Think of the UI like the external appearance and behavior of a dinosaur. Just as a dinosaur's skin, scales, and movements were the interface between its internal systems and the external world, our UI is the interface between our internal systems and the user. The chat interface is like the dinosaur's mouth - the primary way it communicates with the world. The task windows are like the dinosaur's eyes - focused views of specific information!
