# Plans Directory üìã

Welcome to the **strategic planning headquarters** of our project! This is where we map out our expeditions into the unknown territories of bug fixes and feature development. Think of this as our "expedition planning room" - where we chart our course through the digital wilderness!

> **Cartography Fun Fact**: The word "cartography" comes from the Greek words "chartis" (map) and "graphein" (to write). We're essentially writing maps of our codebase and the problems we need to solve! üó∫Ô∏è

### üö® **Active Investigations**

- **[API Duplication Investigation Plan](API_DUPLICATION_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md)** - Our "Grand Canyon expedition" to map the race condition
- **[Laminar Settings Migration Plan](laminar-settings-migration-plan.md)** - Our "continental drift" project for settings migration

### üéØ **Quick Reference**

#### **Something's Broken?**

1. Start here: [API Duplication Investigation Plan](API_DUPLICATION_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md)
2. Check the symptoms: [Problem Description](../docs/architecture/API_DUPLICATION_RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md#problem-description)
3. Understand the race: [State Machines](../docs/architecture/state-machines/)
4. Find the fix: [Solution Recommendations](../docs/architecture/API_DUPLICATION_RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md#solution-recommendations)

#### **Need to Understand the System?**

1. Start here: [Architecture Overview](../docs/architecture/README.md)
2. Explore the problem: [Race Condition Analysis](../docs/architecture/API_DUPLICATION_RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md)
3. See the state machines: [State Machines Index](../docs/architecture/state-machines/INDEX.md)

## ü¶ï Dinosaur Analogy

Think of our plans like different types of dinosaur expeditions:

- **API Duplication Plan** = **Tyrannosaurus Rex Hunt** - The apex predator hunt, going after the biggest, most dangerous bug
- **Laminar Settings Plan** = **Brontosaurus Migration** - The gentle giant migration, moving large amounts of data
- **Future Plans** = **Velociraptor Pack** - Fast, coordinated, multiple small tasks working together

## üî¨ Research Areas

### Current Focus

- **3-Request Race Condition**: The "meteor impact" that causes mass extinction (session corruption)
- **Green Text Trigger**: The "volcanic eruption" that starts the chain reaction
- **Synchronization**: The "evolutionary adaptation" needed to survive

### Next Steps

1. **Map the exact sequence** of state transitions during race conditions
2. **Design the synchronization mechanism** to prevent concurrent access
3. **Implement monitoring** to detect when we're approaching a "mass extinction event"

### Reading Order

1. **Start with the problem**: [API Duplication Investigation Plan](API_DUPLICATION_INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md)
2. **Understand the mechanics**: [State Machines](../docs/architecture/state-machines/)
3. **See the system in action**: [Orchestrator System](../docs/orchestrator/)
4. **Plan your solution**: [Solution Recommendations](../docs/architecture/API_DUPLICATION_RACE_CONDITION_ANALYSIS.md#solution-recommendations)

### Cross-References

- Each plan contains "**Next Steps**" sections pointing to related topics
- Look for "**Related Documentation**" at the bottom of each page
- Use the navigation breadcrumbs to trace your path
